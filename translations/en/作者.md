## Personal Experience

During university, I self-taught multiple programming languages and tech stacks, such as Java backend, frontend, and mini-program development. As the head of the studio, I led the development of **dozens of** websites, and graduated with **first-class academic performance**, won the National Scholarship, the **National Award** in the Challenge Cup academic competition and the **Special Award** in Shanghai, and was named an Outstanding Graduate of Shanghai and the University's Person of the Year. In my third year of university, I published the textbook "Blockchain Smart Contract Technology and Application", and also had internships at three companies, including **ByteDance** and **Tencent**.

During the autumn recruitment, I received offers from multiple large companies, and finally became a permanent employee at Tencent with **the top score in the group**, and secured an **SSP highest level** offer.

Working at Tencent for nearly 4 years, I independently led the development of BI projects and big data development, won the **championship** in Tencent's internal application development competition, and was awarded **5-star excellent employee**, and served as a mentor for new employees.

Most of my time is spent on work and creation. Knowledge sharing is my hobby, and I want to leave something useful for everyone.
