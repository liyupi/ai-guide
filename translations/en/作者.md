As the head of a studio, I led the construction of **dozens** of websites, won the National Scholarship with **top academic performance**, the **National Award** & Shanghai **Special Prize** in the Challenge Cup Academic Competition, Shanghai Outstanding Graduate, and University Person of the Year. Published the textbook "Blockchain Smart Contract Technology and Applications" in my junior year, and had internships at fintech companies, **ByteDance**, and **Tencent**.

Received offers from multiple major companies during the autumn recruitment season, ultimately converted to Tencent with **top performance in the team**, securing the **SSP highest-level** offer.

Worked at Tencent for nearly 4 years, independently responsible for BI project development, big data development, etc., won the Tencent Internal Application Development Competition **Championship**, **5-Star Outstanding Employee**, and served as a mentor for newcomers.
