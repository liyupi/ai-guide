## What is Vibe Coding?

Simply put, **Vibe Coding is chatting with AI in plain language and letting AI write code for you**. You don’t need to remember any syntax; just clearly articulate your needs, like "Help me create a budgeting page," and AI will generate it for you. Programming becomes as natural as chatting—that’s the charm of Vibe Coding.

## Why Learn Vibe Coding?

After learning Vibe Coding, you can quickly create tools to enhance office efficiency, develop apps to solve everyday problems, and turn your creative ideas into real, profitable products.

## What’s in This Tutorial?
