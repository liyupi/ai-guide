# AI No-Code Platform

> Build applications by just opening your browser - the simplest Vibe Coding approach

Hello, I'm Yupi.

If you're a complete beginner or just want to quickly validate an idea, then a **no-code platform** is definitely your best choice.

Why is that?

Because no-code platforms have three major advantages:

1. No need to install any software: Just open your browser and start using it
2. No need to know any code: Describe your needs in natural language
3. What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG): See the changes immediately and deploy with one click

In this article, I'll introduce several mainstream no-code platforms in detail, focusing on Baidu Miaoda, and teach you how to choose and use them.

## 1. What is a No-Code Platform?

Before diving into specific tools, let's first clarify: What is a no-code platform?

Simply put, **a no-code platform is an AI-powered programming tool that you can use directly in your browser.**

You only need to describe your requirements in natural language, and the AI will generate a complete application for you, which can be previewed and modified in real-time.

Comparison with traditional development:

Isn't it much simpler? This is the charm of no-code platforms.

### Suitable Scenarios?

No-code platforms are particularly suitable for:

- Complete beginners: Haven't learned programming yet, want to get started quickly
- Rapid prototyping: Need to quickly validate an idea
- Simple applications: Personal websites, landing pages, simple tools
- Learning experience: Want to experience Vibe Coding

Of course, no-code platforms also have limitations. For particularly complex projects, you might still need a code editor. But for most scenarios, no-code platforms are already powerful enough.

Now that you understand the basic concept of no-code platforms, I'll introduce several mainstream platforms in detail. Each platform has its own features and advantages, and I'll demonstrate their usage with practical examples to help you find the one that suits you best.

## 2. Bolt.new - Super-Fast Prototyping Tool

Bolt.new is currently one of the hottest no-code platforms, launched by StackBlitz. Its biggest feature is **speed**—from idea to seeing the result, it might only take 1 minute.

Core advantages of Bolt.new:

1. Extremely fast: Code generation and preview are both quick
2. Real-time preview: See changes as you make them, WYSIWYG
3. One-click deployment: Supports deployment to platforms like Netlify
4. Auto-fix: AI automatically detects and fixes errors

### How to Use Bolt.new?

> 💡 We've already covered Bolt.new usage in the【Basic Must-Read】Quick Start Guide, so you can skip this section.

Using Bolt.new is very simple. Let me demonstrate with a practical example: creating a simple Pomodoro timer.

Steps:

1) Open the [website](https://bolt.new) and enter your requirements in the dialog box:

```
Please help me create a Pomodoro timer with the following features:
- Default 25-minute countdown

3) See the real-time effect in the preview area on the right

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107110658047.png)

4) If unsatisfied, continue adjusting through dialogue. Or use the visual editing feature—click where you want to change.

```
Change the background color to light blue and the buttons to rounded corners
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107110744960.png)

5) Once satisfied, click the "Publish" button to deploy with one click and get a shareable link.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107111103207.png)

It's that simple! The whole process takes less than 5 minutes.

### Pros and Cons of Bolt.new

Bolt.new is great for quickly validating ideas or creating simple demos. It's very fast, has a low learning curve, and requires no coding knowledge—just speak your requirements. You can also view the generated code if you want to learn. Finally, deploying a website is straightforward—just click a button to go live, and you'll get a shareable link.

However, for particularly complex projects, such as those requiring complex backend logic or database operations, Bolt.new might not perform as well. While you can adjust the website through dialogue, for highly detailed customization, it might not be as flexible as writing code directly. Also, it must be used in a browser, and the code editing experience is average.

### Pricing

- Free version: Limited usage, suitable for trial and learning
- Paid version: Around $25/month, removes limitations

If you're a beginner, start with the free version to experience the charm of Vibe Coding. Once you're sure you want to dive deeper, consider upgrading to the paid version.

## 3. Lovable - Full-Stack Application Builder

Lovable is a powerful no-code platform that not only handles frontend but also full-stack applications: including frontend, backend, database, and even user authentication!

Core advantages of Lovable:

1. Full-stack capability: Can build complete web applications
2. Database integration: Built-in Supabase for data storage
3. User authentication: Supports login, registration, etc.
4. High code quality: Generated code is well-structured and easy to maintain

### How to Use Lovable?

Let me demonstrate with a more complex example. Suppose I want to create a simple expense tracking app with login functionality.

Steps:

1) Open the [website](https://lovable.dev) and log in using GitHub or email

2) Enter your requirements in the dialog box:

```
Please help me create an expense tracking app with the following features:
- User login and registration
- Add income and expense records
- Display total income, total expenses, and balance
- Filter records by date
- Data should be saved to a database
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107111601472.png)

3) Lovable will then generate a complete full-stack application, including:

   - Frontend interface (React)
   - Backend API
   - Database schema (Supabase)
   - User authentication system

During this process, you might need to manually confirm some operations, such as enabling Cloud to support database and user authentication:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107111715955.png)

4) After a few minutes, the AI completes the generation, and you can test the functionality in the preview area

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112144754.png)

5) Continue optimizing details through dialogue and visual editing—the editing experience is quite good

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112259442.png)

6) Deploy with one click

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112411553.png)

### Pros and Cons of Lovable

If your project requires backend, database, and user systems, Lovable is a great choice—it can handle more complex full-stack applications.

The generated code is also well-organized, making it easier to export and maintain later. It directly integrates Supabase, a powerful backend service, allowing you to easily handle data storage, user authentication, and other complex functionalities.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112431787.png)

Of course, because it's more powerful, it's also relatively more complex, and beginners might need some time to adapt. Also, since it generates more code (frontend + backend), it might be slower than Bolt.new.

### Pricing

- Free version: Limited usage
- Paid version: Around $25 ~ $50/month

If you're building a complete web application that requires a database and user system, Lovable is an excellent choice. But if you're just creating a simple showcase page, Bolt.new is sufficient.

## 4. Baidu Miaoda - Domestic No-Code Platform

Baidu Miaoda is an AI-powered no-code application building platform launched by Baidu, and one of the most successful no-code platforms in China.

Miaoda's biggest feature is that it not only generates applications but also enables direct commercialization. It has built-in payment functionality (including WeChat Mini Program payments), which can be directly integrated without additional development. Moreover, the interface is entirely in Chinese, making it particularly user-friendly for domestic users.

### How to Use Baidu Miaoda?

Using Miaoda is very simple, just like other no-code platforms:

1) Visit the [Baidu Miaoda official website](https://www.miaoda.cn/), register an account, and log in

2) Describe your requirements in Chinese:

```
Create an online booking system where users can select a date and time, fill in contact information, and submit a booking
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112754177.png)

3) Next, enter the development phase, and the AI might confirm your requirements through dialogue.

If you want to create a commercial-grade project, communicate thoroughly with it; if you're just making a demo for fun, you can skip the dialogue.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112932144.png)

Then the AI generates a requirements document:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113021068.png)

You can manually edit the document or directly generate the application immediately.

After waiting a few minutes, the AI automatically generates a complete application, and you can preview the results in real-time:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113641264.png)

5) Like other platforms, you can modify the application. It supports visual editing, and the editing experience is quite good.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113743213.png)

6) Once satisfied, you can directly publish it and get an access link.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113853665.png)

7) If you need more capabilities, you can extend functionality using plugins, such as integrating WeChat Pay for charging fees

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113922034.png)

### Pros and Cons of Baidu Miaoda

Miaoda's biggest advantage is its Chinese-friendly interface—no need to know English. It also has strong commercialization capabilities, with built-in payment functionality, allowing you to directly create paid applications, with many successful cases to reference.

However, based on my tests, compared to foreign platforms, the generated results are relatively average, suitable for small to medium-sized applications.

But for domestic users, especially those wanting to create Mini Programs or quickly commercialize in the Chinese market, Miaoda is a good choice.

## 5. AI Application Development Platforms

Besides the no-code platforms mentioned above, there are platforms specifically for developing AI applications, such as Dify, Coze, Alibaba Cloud Bailian, etc.

Their positioning is different from no-code platforms like Bolt.new. Bolt.new is mainly used to generate regular websites and applications, while AI application development platforms are primarily used to build AI chatbots, AI knowledge base Q&A, AI workflows, and other applications that require AI capabilities.

In short, if you're building a regular website or application (like a personal homepage or e-commerce site), Bolt.new or Baidu Miaoda is sufficient. If you're building an AI application (like a smart customer service, AI assistant, or knowledge base Q&A system), you can try Dify or Coze.

![Dify Developing AI Applications](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1743561915955-ad27735a-c927-4207-b769-03fda32081b6.png)

These platforms provide visual configuration interfaces, allowing you to build AI workflows through drag-and-drop, creating powerful AI applications without writing code.

## 6. How to Choose a No-Code Platform?

By now, you might be asking: With so many platforms, each with its own strengths, which one should I choose?

Actually, the choice is simple—it mainly depends on your needs and personal situation.

1) Choose based on needs

If you're a domestic user and want to create Mini Programs or need commercialization, Baidu Miaoda is the first choice—it's Chinese-friendly and has built-in payment functionality, with hundreds of thousands of successful commercial cases.

If you need to quickly prototype or create simple pages, Bolt.new is fast and easy to use—you can see results in 1 ~ 2 minutes. If you need to build a complete web application with a database and user system, Lovable is a better choice—it's the most powerful.

2) Choose based on personal situation

If you're a complete beginner (never written code), start with Baidu Miaoda or Bolt.new—they're the simplest and easiest to get started with. If you have some basics (learned some programming), you can try Lovable—it's more powerful and can handle more complex tasks.

My suggestion is to start with Baidu Miaoda or Bolt.new, then gradually try other platforms based on your needs.

## 7. Practical Tips for Using No-Code Platforms

During my use of no-code platforms, I've summarized some practical tips to share with you.

1) Be specific in describing requirements

Don't just say "build a website"—describe in detail, such as "build a personal portfolio website with a homepage (big title + introduction + avatar), project showcase (card layout), contact information, clean and modern style, using a blue color scheme." The more specific your requirements, the closer the AI-generated result will be to your expectations.

2) Implement step by step

Don't make too many requests at once—do it step by step. First, build the basic framework, then add features, and finally optimize details. This makes it easier to control progress and identify and fix issues.

3) If you have reference designs, upload images for the AI to reference—this can generate UI that better matches your expectations.

4) After each AI code generation, always test in the preview area. For example, click all buttons to see if functionality works, check effects on different screen sizes, input test data to see if it displays correctly. If you find issues, immediately ask the AI to fix them—don't let problems pile up.

5) Before making major changes, it's best to save the current version. Most platforms support version history, so you can revert if something goes wrong.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107114739910.png)

6) Finally, even if you don't know code now, you can export the generated code and save it. Later, when you're learning, you can revisit and study how the code was written.
