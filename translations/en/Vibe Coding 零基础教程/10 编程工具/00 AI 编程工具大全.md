# AI Programming Tools Guide

> Choose the right AI programming tool for you

Hello, I'm Yupi, a former Tencent full-stack developer and an [AI programming blogger](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453) with over 2 million followers. I'm also the creator of [AI Navigation](https://ai.codefather.cn) and [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn), along with 10+ other self-developed products.

If you've completed the "Essential Reading" section and successfully built your first web application, congratulations! You've already experienced the charm of Vibe Coding!

But you might have some questions:

- The web AI generator is quite useful, but I heard Cursor is more powerful. Which one should I use?
- What are the differences between AI models like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini that I see online?
- Some tools are free, while others require payment. How should I choose?

Don't worry, these confusions are completely normal. Faced with dozens or even hundreds of AI programming tools on the market, even professional programmers can feel overwhelmed.

This section is specifically designed to address these questions.

## 1. Why Should You Understand Programming Tools?

In the traditional programming era, the choice of tools wasn't that crucial. Whether you used VS Code or Sublime Text, the code you wrote was the same.

But in the Vibe Coding era, **choosing the right tool can boost your development efficiency by 10 times!**

Why is that?

Because different AI programming tools:

1. Vary greatly in capabilities: Some tools can only generate simple code, while others can help you build entire projects.
2. Have different use cases: Some are suitable for prototyping, others for product development, and some for learning.
3. Differ significantly in cost: Some are completely free, while others cost hundreds per month.
4. Have different learning curves: Some are easy to use right away, while others require some foundational knowledge.

Choosing the right tool can make your work事半功倍; choosing the wrong one might make you think "Vibe Coding is just so-so."

## 2. The 3 Major Types of AI Programming Tools

Before diving into specific tools, let's first look at the basic classification of AI programming tools. Based on usage and complexity, I categorize them into 3 major types:

### No-Code Platforms

These can be used directly in the browser without installing any software or knowing any code. They are suitable for complete beginners and those who want to quickly create prototypes.

Representative tools: Bolt.new, Lovable, Miaoda

Advantages: Easy to get started, WYSIWYG, automatic deployment

Limitations: Relatively simple functionality, may struggle with complex projects

### AI Code Editors

These require downloading and installation, with interfaces similar to traditional code editors but equipped with powerful AI assistants. They are suitable for those with some foundational knowledge who want to delve deeper into Vibe Coding or work on complex projects.

Representative tools: Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, Augment Code

Advantages: Powerful features, high flexibility, suitable for large projects

Limitations: Requires some learning curve, not very beginner-friendly

### Command-Line Tools

These allow interaction with AI through the command line in the terminal, suitable for developers with programming experience and command-line enthusiasts.

Representative tools: Claude Code, Gemini CLI

Advantages: Highly efficient, strong automation, cost-effective

Limitations: Requires technical expertise, not recommended for beginners
