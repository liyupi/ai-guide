## Personal Experience

During college, I taught myself multiple programming languages and tech stacks, such as Java backend, frontend, mini-program development, etc. As the studio head in school, I led the team to build **dozens of** websites, won the National Scholarship with **first in the major**, won the **National Prize** in the Challenge Cup Academic Competition & Shanghai **Special Prize**, Shanghai Outstanding Graduate, and University Person of the Year. In my junior year, I published the textbook "Blockchain Smart Contract Technology and Applications," and also had internship experience at three companies: a financial technology company, **ByteDance**, and **Tencent**.

During fall recruitment, I received offers from multiple major companies, finally joining Tencent with **first in the group** performance, securing the **SSP highest level** offer.

Working at Tencent for nearly 4 years, independently responsible for BI project R&D, big data R&D, etc. Won the Tencent Internal Application Development Competition **Championship**, **5-Star Outstanding Employee**, and served as a new employee mentor.

Most of my time is spent on work + creation. Knowledge sharing is my hobby, and I want to leave something useful for everyone.
