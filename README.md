## 🔥 Fish Skin's Vibe Coding Zero-Based Tutorial


Nowadays, **Vibe Coding** has taken the internet by storm! Not only programmers, but also designers, product managers, and even people with no technical background at all are starting to use Vibe Coding to realize their ideas, creating their own products with AI and making profits.

I single-handedly created this [Vibe Coding Zero-Based Tutorial](https://ai.codefather.cn/vibe) with **thousands of images and hundreds of thousands of words**, combining my two and a half years of experience in AI programming + project development + product monetization. The goal is only one:

**Help anyone quickly master Vibe Coding, even with zero foundation, and rapidly develop and launch their own products to make a profit.**

To be shamelessly bold, I dare say this free tutorial beats 90% of paid Vibe Coding content.
