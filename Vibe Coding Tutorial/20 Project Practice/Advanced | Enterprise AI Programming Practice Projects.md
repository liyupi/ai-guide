# More Enterprise-Level AI Programming Practice Projects


Hello, I'm Programmer Fish Skin.

In previous articles, we learned the Vibe Coding project development process and practiced many personal projects. These projects can help you get started with AI programming and master basic development skills.

But if you want to further improve your programming skills and build more competitive projects to help you find programming-related jobs and get offers, I recommend learning more enterprise-level AI programming practice projects.

As the founder of [Codefather](https://codefather.cn/), a top-tier programming learning website in China, I've been leading everyone in building projects for several years. Many students have successfully received offers from major companies by learning these projects!

In this article, I'll introduce my enterprise-level AI project tutorials on the [Codefather platform](https://codefather.cn/). These projects are carefully designed by me, benchmarking against real enterprise business scenarios, covering all aspects of AI application development. Project materials include complete video tutorials / text tutorials, runnable complete source code, resume writing techniques, interview question solutions, and Q&A support—truly a one-stop service.

👉🏻 Before starting projects, I recommend reading [Fish Skin's Project Learning Suggestions](https://www.codefather.cn/post/1797431216467001345) first to choose projects suitable for you and learn efficient project development methods.



## I. Why Learn Enterprise-Level Projects?

You might ask: I already know how to use Vibe Coding to build projects, why do I need to learn enterprise-level projects?

The reason is simple: the gap between personal projects and enterprise-level projects is huge.

Personal projects focus on rapid feature implementation, while enterprise-level projects focus on:

- Complete development process (requirements analysis, architecture design, development, testing, deployment)
- Standardized code quality (coding standards, design patterns, unit testing)
- Real business scenarios (user authentication, permission control, data security)
- System architecture design (microservices, distributed systems, high concurrency)
- Continuous operations and monitoring (logging, monitoring, performance optimization)

Learning enterprise-level projects not only improves your technical skills but also helps you understand how real commercial projects are developed. This is incredibly helpful for job seeking and work.

Moreover, these projects integrate the latest AI technologies, allowing you to keep up with the trends of the AI era while mastering traditional development skills.



## II. Fish Skin's AI Project Series

Below are the enterprise-level AI project tutorials I offer on the Codefather platform. These projects are all personally designed and taught by me, and each project comes with complete tutorials and supporting materials.
