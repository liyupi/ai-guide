# Cursor + Cordova - Emoji Generator APP Project Practice

This project will take you through developing an app that runs on mobile phones using pure Vibe Coding methods, without writing a single line of code.

This is a typical Vibe Coding project. Fish Skin will explain how to use AI to generate a webpage, then package it as an app through tools. The focus is on learning to use the Cordova tool and the app packaging process, suitable for students who want to quickly create apps.



---

The APP you're seeing now was completely generated by me using AI—I didn't write a single line of code! How did I do it?

Hello everyone, I'm Programmer Fish Skin. AI is developing quickly, and now you can casually generate a website, but how do you purely use AI to develop an APP that runs on mobile phones? There are basically no complete tutorials online. So, I stepped up—below, in just a few minutes, I'll teach you how to use AI to generate an APP. Still a **nanny-level tutorial**.

Now let's welcome our protagonist `Cordova`!

## I. What is Cordova?

Apache Cordova is an open-source mobile application development framework that allows developers to use web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop **cross-platform** mobile applications. By encapsulating web technologies in native containers, it enables developers to write code once and then run it on multiple platforms like Android, iOS, Windows, and more.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749628169384-9f90fa60-e328-46c8-99eb-6f4f343b8aeb.png)

Cordova is mainly implemented through the following core components—interested students can learn more:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20250612190256834.png)

In other words, to develop an APP, we just need to give our website files to Cordova, install plugins as needed, modify configurations, and then directly use its build tools to package the web application into a native APP application (like an APK file)! It involves almost no code writing or development.

Sounds simple, right? Anyone can do it? But to use Cordova to develop APPs, you must install the corresponding environment on your computer, such as Android and iOS. The difficulty of installing the environment can be said to be **very explosive**!

If you struggle on your own, it might take at least a few days, you'll encounter many pitfalls, and searching online for various solutions might not necessarily solve it. That's why I made this tutorial—I've already stepped on all the pitfalls for everyone. I'll **get you set up with the environment in the shortest time, and teach you how to use AI + Cordova to generate an APP**. Before starting, remember to **like, save, and follow**. Please, my hair is really running out!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749628109290-90dc8199-664a-4994-8dfe-716b4f8b5b71.png)

## II. Environment Preparation

### Installing Cordova

First we need to install Cordova. Cordova depends on Node.js and NPM frontend tools. Just download from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn) and it will automatically install NPM.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749628757935-a1f29765-c0e8-4c3a-9486-e113f3814e8d.png)

You can understand NPM as a small tool for quickly installing various software. After installation, open the terminal and execute the following command to install Cordova:

```bash
npm install -g cordova
```

Cordova supports packaging websites as Android and iOS mobile apps, as well as Electron desktop applications. Below, Fish Skin will take you through installing what I personally consider the most difficult—the **Android environment**. Note that each of the following steps isn't actually difficult, but you must read carefully! Not paying attention to one detail might cause an error!



### Installing Android Environment

First, we need to determine the required environment and tool versions based on the Cordova version. Since we installed the latest version of Cordova, we can directly read the [latest official documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/dev/guide/platforms/android/index.html). For example, the dependencies I need here are as follows:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749470136150-38d5fe30-e3e3-4994-8c06-ada90cc3deb7.png)

Among these, the most important are:

- Java 17
- Gradle 8.13
- Android API level >= 24

Below we'll install these dependencies separately.



#### 1. Installing Java

The Java version must be 17. It's best to find a ready-made [Java installation package for Windows systems](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&os=windows&package=jdk#zulu):

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749629753199-b8458627-2a44-4d5b-8786-74bc1d5b83bc.png)

When installing Java, it's recommended to choose **automatically configure environment variables** (including Path and JAVA_HOME), so you don't need to manually configure environment variables yourself.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748604000379-99f42d77-7198-4c44-989c-914f21175452.png)

After installation, open the terminal and execute the `java -version` command to check the version number. Seeing the following output indicates success:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748604045327-9e78c03d-dff8-4823-a6f8-221b1c288b77.png)

If the command can't execute, it's likely the Path environment variable wasn't configured.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749715203575-d424aa3d-9be3-4e55-936e-8c99211a10a9.png)



#### 2. Installing Gradle

According to the version number above, Gradle must be 8.13. Just download the binary archive directly from the [official website](https://gradle.org/releases/).

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749470207621-4d12c5fa-6849-49eb-807a-46512cbd7011.png)

Extract the downloaded archive, move it to a **path that doesn't contain Chinese characters**, then configure environment variables, including Path and GRADLE_HOME:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749470552544-1d872d78-933d-404e-a5d3-95071f98f72c.png)

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749471051766-77ad3676-a1f4-449a-9c6c-3db9adaf5484.png)

Open the terminal and execute the `gradle -v` command to check the version number:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749470606188-7af15756-34de-4f77-b469-6b88afc5e6bd.png)

If the command can't execute, it's likely the Path environment variable was configured incorrectly.



#### 3. Installing Android

It's recommended to directly install the Android development tool [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=zh-cn), which will automatically install Android's development SDK and runtime environment.

Download Android Studio from the official website, run the installer, and follow the steps to install:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748600319317-775ad570-b84d-441e-9538-3f654e0c0280.png)

After installation, when you first open Android Studio, it will remind you to install the Android SDK environment:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748600394690-c64893b5-28f2-439e-afc2-302b616c2cb6.png)

Note not to install SDK components in a directory containing Chinese characters. Fortunately, the installer also has this restriction, or more people would fall...

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748601041213-24016b9f-a6ce-4e8e-afba-a412cdee7dab.png)

Next, just install without thinking—it will automatically install various commonly used Android development tools, as well as an Android device emulator:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748601061577-19061773-bea7-4f90-8fd4-588a99049611.png)

This step might be a bit torturous. Friends in some regions might need some special network support, you know what I mean.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748601238964-92c8754e-7c98-4c5d-9b4d-d1a1ede316ed.png)

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748601268568-8e5e99b1-0792-49f3-9bd1-d8073282743a.png)

After a long wait, the Android SDK is finally installed. Then you need to configure the Android environment variable ANDROID_HOME:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749469684248-b1c77491-ca2b-49bd-a4e4-fffcef962868.png)

You also need to configure platform-tools into Path, which contains some command-line tools:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749469743427-c052d689-2746-4522-a37d-4ba5513cf857.png)



After configuration, open Android Studio, enter SDK Manager settings in the upper right corner, and install the SDK for the corresponding API Level based on Cordova's version requirements. For example, I installed versions 34 and 35.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748604140186-2cfeee7a-5cce-4647-8dc6-98afc4c7e980.png)

This step might also be quite slow—wait patiently for the installation~

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748604151163-82381d25-9824-446c-b418-54e758de9a5f.png)

After installing the SDK, enter the SDK tools option and install Command-line Tools command-line tools, which might be used later when running Android APK packages on your computer:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749607562141-66bfc793-a918-4359-b574-a8d52bc250a1.png)

Similarly, add Command-line Tools to the environment variable Path. The path is `%ANDROID_HOME%\cmdline-tools\latest\bin`. This way, many tools can be used directly in the terminal, such as apkanalyzer.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749607796266-a0dbb7b1-62ab-4b43-abcb-796b7261d45a.png)



#### 4. Installing Android Device Emulator

Below we'll try to run an Android phone emulator on our computer, which makes debugging programs more convenient.

Open Android Studio's device manager and add a new device:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749609766461-16befd69-65e1-4c07-bb6a-7e5ee2500dc4.png)

Choose a specific device model. It's recommended to choose a higher API version. I chose Pixel 7:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749610449536-edf49ed9-852c-425f-b3a0-a7e7bcc95d90.png)

Install the recommended system image:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749609929190-ad696301-b3d1-4642-98b1-56e303f0856a.png)

Wait patiently and the phone is created successfully. Run it directly:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749610968230-15d4f951-0407-49c1-9453-d8d2035f9a6d.png)

Result—error!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749610958509-4da79a4e-781a-48e5-bf97-93383de6b4ff.png)

If you also encounter this situation, you can manually run the virtual device by **entering the Android emulator directory** in the terminal. This allows you to see detailed error messages, which helps troubleshoot problems.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749611297041-de408f6c-6acc-425e-bd7f-646c3c41fcb4.png)

For me, it was clearly because the path contained Chinese! How hateful—back when I was young and frivolous, I didn't pay attention and used a Chinese path...

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749611342058-e78e5020-2a11-4403-8bdb-28c1788d4287.png)

The solution is simple—manually create an avd virtual device directory without Chinese in the path, then set the environment variable ANDROID_SDK_HOME:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749612398190-b65661c4-b4c3-4d64-aeb1-491ec40ac55b.png)

Then use Android Studio to create and run a device again. This time it runs successfully—congratulations, you have another phone!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749612554480-2514015b-1592-49ee-83dd-fae7af6a6918.png)

至此，环境终于搞定了，下面来实战 AI + Cordova 开发 APP。

## III. AI + Cordova Practice

### Creating a Project

Open the terminal, enter the directory where you want to create the project, and first execute the `cordova create` command to create a project:

```bash
cordova create <your project English name>
```

The first time you create a project, you might see a prompt:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748595666543-fd4ae41b-7edc-4443-bab6-3e6ff8eeb819.png)



### Generating Code

There are 2 generation modes here:

1. Create a Cordova project first, then perform AI code generation within that project. Tell AI you want to create a Cordova APP compatible website, and directly let AI generate code compatible with the APP. The advantage of this approach is that the generated code **can use Cordova plugins to call native system capabilities**, such as calling the camera to take photos.

2. Use AI to generate a website project separately outside the Cordova project. AI won't care whether you want to convert the project to a Cordova APP, then move the generated website into the Cordova project. The advantage of this approach is that the generated website code is easier to run, and it's **suitable for scenarios where you already have an existing website project**.

Below I'll demonstrate both methods. First, let's talk about the first mode—directly let AI generate a Cordova APP for an 【Emoji Generator】.

Open the Cordova project directory you just created with Cursor, and give AI the following prompt. The prompt needs to include Cordova and mention **compatibility**:

```shell
Please help me develop a [Mobile Emoji Generator] Web APP using pure frontend technology + Cordova.
If needed, you can call native system functions through Cordova.

Please generate complete project code, ensure complete and usable functionality, and all features must be compatible with both web and mobile devices.

## 📋 Feature Requirements
### 1. Image Acquisition
- Support camera photography
- Support selecting image files from local
- Automatically scale images to appropriate size

### 2. Meme Templates
- Provide 8-10 common meme templates (shocked, speechless, thumbs up, like, emo, etc.)
- Grid layout to display templates, click to select and apply

### 3. Text Editing
- Input custom text content
- Adjust font size (20px-50px)
- Choose text color (white, black, red, and other basic colors)
- Add text stroke effect
- Drag to move text position

### 4. Sticker Function
- Provide common emoji stickers (😂🤣😭😍🤔 etc. 5-10)
- Provide simple decorative stickers (stars, hearts, arrows, etc.)
- Support drag movement and simple scaling

### 5. Save Function
- Export edited meme as image
- Support downloading and saving locally

## 🎨 Interface Requirements
- Mobile first: adapt to phone screens, large button design
- Page layout:
  - Home page: camera button, select image button
  - Edit page: top toolbar + center canvas + bottom function area
- Simple operation: real-time preview effect, one-click save

## 📱 Operation Flow
1. Take photo or select image
2. Choose meme template
3. Edit text content and style
4. Add emoji or decorative stickers
5. Preview effect and save image
```

AI will put the generated website files in the `www` directory. After code generation is complete, AI might automatically remind you of the commands to package and run the APP. You need to add the Android platform, install plugins, package, and run in sequence.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748596578547-e99a9448-e4a3-421c-907f-5e85c3b24ea2.png)

We'll use these commands in a bit. Don't execute them automatically yet, because the generated code might not be directly usable—we need to debug using the web version first.



### Web Browsing

You can directly double-click the generated HTML file `www/index.html` to see the effect. Of course, it's more recommended to add a platform through cordova commands and run.

First add the browser platform:

```shell
cordova platform add browser
```

If you encounter an error when executing the command, you can directly ask AI. For example, Fish Skin encountered a lack of command execution permission error:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748597149478-5d93aa00-a15d-41a7-b7b3-6011c9098420.png)

The solution is to execute the following command to modify PowerShell's execution policy:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

After successfully adding the platform, you can enter the `cordova run` command to run the platform:

```bash
cordova run browser
```

Then you can see the running effect of the website. Note that due to the特殊性 of the Cordova Browser platform, the web effect run through this command might be different from directly double-clicking or starting a local server.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749632376309-d49aa1f5-15fa-47ac-8ecc-34fafa453a17.png)

Besides the above command, if you want to quickly debug multiple different platforms, you can run the following command to view all platforms uniformly:

```bash
cordova serve --port 8000
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749632540888-2c8274ca-b2bc-488b-9d55-da8999b57a87.png)

### Adding Android Platform

Next, execute a similar command to add the Android platform:

```bash
cordova platform add android
```

As shown in the figure, Android platform added successfully. Note to **ensure the output Target SDK and Compile SDK versions are consistent**:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749554296373-e755253d-c2e9-4367-87a4-9c9e24402f20.png)

If they're inconsistent, it might affect APP operation. You can modify the `config.xml` targetSdkVersion to change the version number:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749548403555-9eb701bd-bd9f-469f-a672-b56d033c8b91.png)

### Adding Plugins

Since my project needs to call the camera, I need to add the corresponding plugin. Execute the following command:

```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera
```

Plugin added successfully:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748597252238-9c9d7da6-1b6e-42b1-ad5e-714498f21b67.png)



### Packaging and Running Android APP

#### Packaging

After installing plugins, execute the `cordova build` command to package an Android APK:

```bash
cordova build android
```

Seeing the following information indicates successful packaging:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749554490277-687fea6b-175e-4097-92e0-37090d4f3c63.png)

After getting the APK package, there are 2 ways to run it:

#### Running on Phone

You can directly send the APK package to your phone to install and run:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749608745115-c35207fa-a32c-4dc2-a74f-10244b993e51.png)

Running effect as shown:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749609325122-30c51d37-aeaa-4e4e-95a1-6565dc212266.jpeg)

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749609327998-acbfdfbd-6982-4be4-9f77-d116046194a0.jpeg)



#### Running on Computer

First open Android Studio and start an Android virtual device, then execute the `cordova run` command:

```bash
cordova run android
```

This will install the APK into the virtual device and run the APP. Effect as shown:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749612728673-2c8f7bd0-ecc5-46c4-b24c-573498a70e63.png)



### Common Errors

Packaging and running is where you're most likely to encounter errors. You might encounter many types of errors, such as missing plugins, missing files, inability to install dependencies, inability to run, etc. It's recommended to directly send the error message to AI and let it help you solve it.

Below, Fish Skin shares some pitfalls I encountered.

#### 1. Project Missing Files

For example, Fish Skin's project was missing icon files:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748597545640-7b26e31f-4c7e-4f57-999f-adbf5b2994ad.png)

AI tried to help me create icons:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748597699107-c363caa4-1e59-4fd6-ba4a-3004414b2c7c.png)

Or be simple and crude—remove references to icons in the configuration file:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748597731494-234f4827-eef8-4a1d-9f00-0ed01b61d66d.png)



#### 2. Missing Environment Variables

If environment setup doesn't go smoothly, you might encounter the following error. Just perform the corresponding configuration based on the error message:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1748599524081-e2121c56-11bc-4504-bd2d-6a5fff26f4fb.png)



#### 3. Command Execution Failure

Executing `cordova run` results in command execution failure error, possibly because `cmdline-tools` wasn't configured in the environment variable Path.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749607603308-b1dac4af-1505-4e15-b2ab-25ffd9abf3a5.png)



#### 4. Gradle Installation Failure

Even though Gradle is already installed, Cordova will still install Gradle, and might fail to download due to network reasons:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749469918640-07f5eca4-5651-4e35-91a5-222c43363004.png)

At this point, we can configure the environment variable `CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL` to specify downloading Gradle locally. Set the environment variable value to the path of the Gradle archive we downloaded ourselves.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749471697598-c7dd5754-4e58-4b01-9787-5889a0f9df52.png)

If after modifying the configuration and executing the packaging command again you still get an error, it's recommended to delete the `platforms/android/.gradle` cache in the project and retry.



## IV. Packaging Existing Projects as APPs

Just now we practiced directly using AI to generate Cordova APP projects. If we already have existing website projects, we can also conveniently package them as APPs.

For example, Fish Skin now has a Match-3 web game project. Let's package it as an APP:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749614057458-74ba49c0-d249-43ab-9946-631c8783cc75.png)

1) First create a cordova project:

```bash
cordova create yu-game-web-app
```

2) Copy the existing web files into the www directory:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749614211678-13686f0e-7921-4abe-9ed2-beaf031ff38d.png)

3) Execute cordova command to add Android platform:

```bash
cordova platform add android
```

4) Finally, package or run directly:

```bash
cordova run android
```

Running successfully, the effect is as shown—it's quite nice~

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749614429684-50917cff-d0fc-4c0f-be7d-c356e7827410.png)



## Finally

OK, the tutorial ends here. Due to lack of devices and other reasons, I won't demonstrate iOS for now.

Finally, some suggestions. Cordova is quite suitable for small and medium-sized website projects, especially scenarios where you already have a website project and want to quickly convert it to an APP. But if you need to develop a complex large project that depends on many native capabilities of mobile devices, using Cordova isn't very appropriate—Flutter would be better. Especially for students without programming ability, I recommend not directly using AI to generate complex Cordova APPs—you're likely to encounter code problems you can't solve. But making some small games and small tools is quite good. I also hope my sharing helps everyone. Friends who want more programming and AI tips remember to follow Fish Skin. Bye bye~
