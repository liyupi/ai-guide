# Cursor + LangChain4j - AI Programmer Training Ground Project Practice

This project is an AI programmer training ground that helps programmers improve their technical skills through gamification. Users choose a technology direction and difficulty level, and AI automatically generates challenge tasks. Users receive rewards and experience points upon completing challenges.

This is a full-stack project primarily using Vibe Coding, with AI used throughout the development process. Both frontend and backend can be generated using tools like Cursor. The focus is on learning how to use AI to generate complete full-stack projects, suitable for students who want to learn AI application development and build their own products.

Estimated time: 6 ~ 12 hours.

Project code is free and open source: https://github.com/liyupi/coder-test

Without further delay, prepare to challenge. May your fortune be prosperous!

First, please choose your cultivation direction. Do you even need to think? Of course it's Java backend - the foundation of our profession.

After waiting a moment, the challenge officially begins.

This time you need to implement a Spring Boot-based library management system, with a target salary of - believe it or not - your dream 8000 yuan!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760438873460-36f24edc-31e3-42ee-be87-4c58e7c9c7f6.png)



You first carefully read the requirements. Hmph, nothing more than CRUD skills - piece of cake, right?

Then you come to the options area. The challenge rules are very simple - just select the technologies that can and are suitable for implementing this requirement, and drag them to the answer area.

First, select all your usual trusted tools like Spring Boot, MyBatis, MySQL, Lombok - easy as pie!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760438935115-c22680b8-7009-4dce-bd68-44a58040851d.png)



However, you didn't expect there to be so many exotic techniques - truly eye-opening.

What's this DDD, TDD, CQRS architecture, hexagonal architecture? Though you don't know what these esoteric arts are, they sound profound and mysterious. Selecting them must be good!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760438953486-924cff33-718f-4529-9122-57e05c07782a.png)



Come, let's see the results. 8000 monthly salary, here I come!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760438981041-3e54d4a0-036e-4af5-8cec-ec1e344a1ec1.png)



What?! You actually got 400 yuan deducted!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439049424-532d6ad1-0600-4654-bd9b-311d48cfdc2f.png)

"Congratulations! You successfully designed a simple library management system into a cosmic-level complex architecture! Suggest direct promotion to CTO, responsible for planning the next human lunar landing software system. Suggest learning 'Hello World' before discussing hexagonal architecture."

You have to say, this AI really has a dirty mouth when scolding people!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439092397-5b225c9e-8a3b-4508-8479-a0182975f8a4.png)

Unwilling to accept this, you carefully study the result report generated by AI.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439118337-09c71f6d-6194-408d-aa2b-0b98e4312daf.png)

Oh, so it was over-designed...

Each technology has clear introductions and application scenarios, and thoughtfully provides system architecture diagrams and core business flow charts, afraid you might not understand.

Further down, AI also provides detailed learning suggestions.

"For the 3k-8k salary range, companies value solid fundamentals and practical ability more" - this is quite pertinent.

Additionally, it provides some programming cultivation secret techniques and related interview questions. The recommendations are very accurate, all high-frequency questions closely related to technical knowledge that companies often ask.

Moreover, each question has detailed answers and can be reviewed through the [Interview Duck Practice System](https://www.mianshiya.com/).

Unwilling to accept defeat, you decide to try again millions of times, determined to break through the 8000 barrier!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439307167-b49136e2-037e-444a-b465-8a8980abbbdf.png)



A month later, after unremitting cultivation, you finally taste the joy of learning IT and having a monthly salary over ten thousand, reaching 15,000 yuan.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439363814-13713b6e-7674-4be8-a7c9-5691183644c5.png)



However, at this point, the difficulty of requirements has reached a higher level.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439432591-eee68a21-d25f-4cb0-9249-96c0c2443d9c.png)

Looking at this level's requirements, although each character is individually recognizable, together they're as obscure as heavenly script.

Looking at the options, they're no longer simple technical terms, but various solutions and implementation details.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439452471-426945f6-a3e2-436b-9013-2754d7c09a7c.png)



You're ready to give up, but seeing your ranking on the salary leaderboard, you grit your teeth and decide to continue cultivating.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439492103-33f97636-b7a3-4622-9887-e2f9c14629fb.png)



Besides continuously challenging higher salary dangerous passes, you can also choose selected levels carefully chosen by the training ground owner:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439533899-2a48936b-d8aa-4310-9d01-ed1179c41a92.png)



This way, you can freely learn more business scenarios and steadily improve your martial arts!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439519631-05710f00-3095-4cd1-bc2b-245e9d687ca0.png)



Finally, another month later, your technical skills have broken through to the minor completion of dark energy, and your salary has risen accordingly.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439579749-f7e8cd21-b8f8-4cb0-a5c1-8a2687e185ac.png)



Having cultivated this far, you can't help but wonder.

- What's the highest level achievable in this training ground?
- What does the most difficult requirement look like?
- How did the creator of this training ground build such a martial arts wonder?
- Are there hidden chickens in the ground?
- What are the unspoken rules?



![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439624999-0279322e-0aba-4f81-88ba-4e8be10ee244.png)



After some searching, you discover that the entire project's code is actually [completely open source](https://github.com/liyupi/coder-test)!

Not only that, the entire project was hand-crafted by Fish Skin Old Dog through live streaming!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439691881-8d4282f9-c585-4a25-bef5-42e4dca440f8.png)



Before the source code, there are no secrets. But live streaming instruction reveals the true essence.

Watching the complete project manual that Fish Skin wrote live, you feel mixed emotions.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439737161-b52085d6-65e2-403f-b334-105550061b59.png)



Although you've learned many solutions and architectures and are good at talking, you discover you can't even write a complete project, let alone write a manual...

At this moment, you finally realize it!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1760439809229-dab5cd86-d4ac-4e56-868c-82df1c65cb54.png)

Perhaps Fish Skin's original intention in building this training ground was to let fellow martial artists start from real requirements, improve technical breadth, and exercise solution design capabilities. This is just a guiding stone - after learning these solution techniques, you still need to rely on yourself to continuously accumulate experience through practical combat.

As the saying goes: "Paper knowledge is shallow; to truly know, you must practice it personally."

Friends interested in Fish Skin's project can directly download the source code, change the AI large model API Key in the project configuration to their own, and happily use it~
