# LangChain4j + Multi-Agent - AI Zero-Code Application Generation Platform Project Practice

This project is an enterprise-grade AI zero-code application generation platform, comparable to commercial products from major tech companies. Users input requirements, and AI automatically generates complete web applications with support for visual editing and one-click deployment.

This project is developed using a combination of manual coding + Vibe Coding, by writing Java backend + LangChain4j code to integrate AI, and using AI tools like Cursor to generate frontend code. The focus is on learning enterprise AI application development, backend microservice architecture, AI agents, AI workflows, performance optimization for commercial-grade products, and monitoring systems.

Suitable for students with some project experience who want to deeply learn AI agent development and add large-scale AI projects to their resume to enhance competitiveness.

💡 This project has a higher difficulty level and includes video tutorials (dozens of hours), text tutorials (150,000 words), ready-made resume writing methods and interview question solutions. Expected time to complete is 40+ hours. Not recommended for friends without backend programming basics.

Project code is free and open source: https://github.com/liyupi/yu-ai-code-mother

## Project Introduction

The project has 4 core capabilities.

1) Intelligent Code Generation: Users input requirement descriptions, AI automatically analyzes and selects appropriate generation strategies, generates code files through tool calling, and uses streaming output to let users see AI's execution process in real time.
