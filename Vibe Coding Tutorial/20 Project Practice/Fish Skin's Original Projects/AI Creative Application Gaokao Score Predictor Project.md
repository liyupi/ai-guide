# AI Creative Application - Gaokao Score Predictor Project Practice

This project is an interesting AI Gaokao (National College Entrance Exam) score predictor, supporting multiple prediction methods: scientific prediction, metaphysical prediction, psychological prediction, and social prediction.

This article doesn't cover the development process, only shares a typical AI creative application case to help broaden your horizons.

Gaokao is coming up soon. Unfortunately, I can't participate this year due to other commitments, so let me help our vast community of test-takers by giving you a Gaokao tool I made myself!

Ding ding ding ding—this is the **Gaokao Score Predictor**!

Experience address: [https://gaokao.codefather.cn](https://gaokao.codefather.cn/)

This is AI black technology from the future that can predict Gaokao scores. Sounds impressive, right? Sounds outrageous?

Come on, come on—test whether you'll get into Tsinghua or Peking University? 985/211? Green翅膀 Vocational School? Or... Bilibili University?

**Recommended to watch the video demo for better effect:** [https://bilibili.com/video/BV1wqTTzoEoo](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1wqTTzoEoo)

There are 4 prediction methods, each one explosive.

First experience 【Scientific Prediction】, sounds scientific already. This is precise prediction based on big data analysis and machine learning algorithms, using multi-dimensional subject ability assessment models, combined with statistical analysis and probability theory calculations, with an error rate no higher than 0.001%. The test method is simple—you just need to input your **expected score for each subject**, click to start scientific prediction. The system will apply advanced Arithmetic addition (that is, **addition operation**), combined with normal distribution theory for precise calculation.

Give it a try!

How about that, is the prediction very accurate? It predicted I could get into top-tier institutions—Tsinghua University!

If I had this good thing back when I took Gaokao, wouldn't I have soared?

You can also download a high-res image of the certificate. Whether sharing your joy with friends and family, or being the brightest one in your WeChat Moments—it satisfies all. This is also the magical effect of the score predictor.

Now try 【Metaphysical Prediction】. So-called metaphysics is a very mysterious discipline—believe and it exists, don't believe and it doesn't. This is mysterious prediction integrating ancient wisdom with modern divination, inheriting Zi Wei Dou Shu, Qimen Dunjia, Zhou Yi Bagua, combining modern astrology and blood type psychology to predict your destiny and academic fortune. Come on, input your name, zodiac sign, blood type, Chinese zodiac, and the most critical birth date—come on!

"

Heaven and Earth mysterious and yellow, Universe vast and chaotic,

Big Dipper seven stars, South Dipper six officers,

Five elements generation and restriction, Bagua deduction,

Yin and Yang wax and wane, Universe rotates!

Three talents established, Four images clear,

Six Jia generals, Nine Palaces flying stars!

Supreme Laojun, urgently as per the order,

Mysterious Heaven Emperor, manifest response!

"

Wow, result is Tsinghua University again. I can only say I'm destined!

Now try my most prideful 【Quantum Mechanics Prediction】, based on Schrödinger equation and wave function theory, using quantum entanglement principles to analyze multi-universe probabilities, breaking through the spacetime limitations of traditional prediction.

Just click the button to start the quantum computing engine, determining your Gaokao score distribution in multiple universes through wave function collapse.

It's coming, it's coming!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749138203811-544cb676-863b-460b-b39e-398374cb2df2.png)

Sure enough, Tsinghua University again! Truly fate is hard to defy! (I swear I added random logic in the program)

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749138273388-e579158e-cd4a-45a4-bde4-0551c815b493.png)

Look at the detailed analysis—turns out my learning state is in a superposition state, turns out my potential has quantum fluctuations, turns out I'm the legendary top student, turns out I'm the light of famous schools!

Finally, let's try the traditional ancient method 【Quick Prediction】, this is a mysterious divination technique **passed down for a millennium**, this is heavenly secret obtained only by connecting to the cosmic energy field through spiritual感应...

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749138468801-0f4dc174-f55a-49f7-9cae-15ee5987fcef.png)

This damn well is drawing lots! Take one, bro~

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749138486223-848f5962-bcdd-4faf-b2ff-27bb3d994098.png)

Damn! The last test result is still Tsinghua University, and this time it's **aiming for full marks**. Honestly, I feel Tsinghua can barely satisfy me anymore...

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1749138501970-7306098c-3c4c-4c44-b56c-840c19b7d4bd.png)

How about that, feel the power of my Gaokao score predictor? Really, I strongly recommend everyone **test before Gaokao**, guaranteed to boost your confidence!

Finally, wish all test-takers success in their exams and a bright future! Remember to apply for computer science major—learn programming, fix bugs, get high salary, triple combo start, reach the peak of life!
