# Spring AI - AI Super Agent Project Practice

This project is a complete AI super agent tutorial, guiding you through developing an AI Love Master application and a super agent with autonomous planning capabilities. Through this project, you can master the AI core concepts, practical AI tools, AI programming techniques, AI framework principles, and AI tuning skills that are essential for programmers in the new era.

This project is developed using a combination of manual coding + Vibe Coding, by writing Java backend + Spring AI code to integrate AI, and using AI tools like Cursor to assist with coding. The focus is on learning enterprise AI application development, core concepts and implementation principles of AI agents, ReAct pattern, tool calling, MCP, and other cutting-edge technologies.

Suitable for students with some project experience who want to systematically learn AI agent development and add AI projects to their resume to enhance competitiveness.

💡 This project has a higher difficulty level and includes video tutorials (dozens of hours), text tutorials (100,000+ words), ready-made resume writing methods and interview question solutions. Expected time to complete is 20+ hours. Not recommended for friends without backend programming basics.

Project code is free and open source: https://github.com/liyupi/yu-ai-agent

## Project Introduction

A project tutorial centered on **AI Development Practice**, guiding everyone to master the AI core concepts, practical AI tools, AI programming techniques, AI framework principles, and AI tuning skills that are essential for programmers in the new era through developing **AI Love Master Application + Super Agent with Autonomous Planning Capabilities**, greatly increasing job competitiveness!

The `AI Love Master Application` can rely on AI large models to solve users' emotional problems, supporting multi-turn conversations, Q&A based on custom knowledge bases, autonomous tool calling and MCP service to complete tasks, such as calling map services to get nearby locations and create dating plans.

### 2. Project Takeaways

This project has novel topic selection and real business. Unlike generic CRUD "everywhere" projects, I'll lead everyone through practical implementation of many new technologies and enterprise application scenarios, using one practical tutorial to **comprehensive cover all AI technologies** that programmers must know, helping you become a sought-after talent in AI-era enterprises, greatly increasing competitiveness for your resume and job search.

I teach **universal project development methods and architecture design patterns**. From this project you will learn:

- Usage of mainstream AI application platforms
- 4 ways to integrate AI large models
- AI development frameworks (Spring AI + LangChain4j)
- Local deployment of AI large models
- Prompt engineering and optimization techniques
- Spring AI core features: such as custom Advisor, conversation memory, structured output
- RAG knowledge base practice, principles and tuning techniques
- PgVector vector database + cloud database services
- Tool Calling practical implementation and principles
- MCP Model Context Protocol and service development
- AI Agent Manus principles and autonomous development
- AI service-orientation and Serverless deployment
- Various new concepts: such as multimodal, agent workflows, A2A protocol, large model evaluation, etc.

For example, RAG core feature practice and full-chain optimization:

The project has other advantages:

- AI cloud platform and programming dual-end practice — not just use AI services, but write them yourself!
- Explain latest AI technologies based on official documentation, meticulous, hands-on documentation and source code!
- Share lots of AI extension knowledge and programming techniques, master best practices!

I lead everyone through dissecting the open-source framework OpenManus source code:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/ae36dd94-e87e-4dfe-ae31-81a6cc32c9e8.png)

Even if you haven't learned the technologies mentioned above, no problem. My original project series focuses on practice, **from 0 to 1** leading everyone to learn technical knowledge and immediately apply it to projects, achieving learning by doing.

From requirements analysis, technology selection, project design, project initialization, Demo writing, development implementation, project optimization, deployment, etc., for every step I explain clearly **from theory to practice**, not missing any detail!

Full of positive project feedback:
