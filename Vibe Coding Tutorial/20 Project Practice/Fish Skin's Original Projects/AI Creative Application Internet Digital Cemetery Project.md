# AI Creative Application - Internet Digital Cemetery Project Practice

This project is an interesting Internet Digital Cemetery website, used to commemorate those once glorious but now closed internet products, including Kaixin Wang, Qvod, TTPlayer, Tudou, and more.

This article doesn't cover the development process, only shares a typical AI creative application case to help broaden your horizons.

Hello everyone, I'm Programmer Fish Skin. I'm sharing a somewhat interesting project—I used AI to make an `Internet Digital Cemetery`! It's used to commemorate those once-glorious internet products.

The idea came quite suddenly. A few days ago while surfing the web, I came across Renren Wang, only to discover that Renren Wang officially stopped service in December 2024. My heart suddenly felt mixed emotions. Thinking back to when I was an elementary school student, I specifically registered on Renren Wang just to play Happy Farm, setting an alarm every day to steal vegetables. That kind of happiness—today's post-00s and post-10s probably can't experience it.

Then I thought about it—after so many years of internet development, how many websites and applications that once accompanied us have quietly disappeared? These memories of the digital age should have a proper place to be preserved. So I had an idea—create a digital cemetery specifically to record those closed internet products.

From design, collecting materials, to development, I used AI entirely to make the entire website, finishing within an hour. I chose the cemetery theme, black and gray tones, and added some subtle animation effects to create a commemorative atmosphere.

Honestly, the result turned out better than I expected, so I even deployed it online and got a domain name: https://gualeme.cn (Is It Dead?). You can also visit and take a look—maybe your DNA will move~

The website includes various domestic and international websites and applications that closed between 2009 and 2024, sorted by year. Each product has a brief introduction and specific shutdown date.

Let me mention a few classic domestic products—these really are a generation's youthful memories.


## Classic Product Review


### Renren Wang (Renren)

As China's version of Facebook, how much youth did it carry for the post-80s and post-90s generations? Back then I played various small games on it, never getting tired of it. Social networking at that time was truly simple and innocent. Sadly, it officially bid us farewell on December 2, 2024.

### TTPlayer

This is the first music player I remember using. I still remember the first song I listened to on it was "A Thousand Miles Away" (千里之外). That simple interface, and the lyrics sync display feature that was considered black technology at the time, accompanied so many people through their student years. After being acquired by Baidu in 2013, it was renamed Baidu Music, so it continues to exist in another form, but that pure TTPlayer era has indeed ended.

### Tudou

Founded in 2005, Tudou shouted the slogan "Everyone is the director of life." In the era before Douyin and Kuaishou, Tudou was our main platform for sharing videos and showcasing creativity. It was also the first platform where I uploaded videos in my life. I still remember uploading my short skits and game recordings, eagerly waiting for the view count to break 10.

After 2012, Tudou merged with Youku, and in 2017 it was completely absorbed by Youku. From an independent brand to completely disappearing, Tudou's decline process dragged on for several years. I guess kids today haven't even heard of this website.

### Tencent Weibo

Launched in 2010, it quickly gained volume with QQ's massive user base. In 2011, registered users even exceeded Sina Weibo. But the rise of WeChat completely changed the game rules. Tencent discovered that WeChat better fit their strategic layout than Weibo, so Tencent Weibo was strategically abandoned. From 2014, it was basically in a "vegetative state" until it officially announced stopping service in 2020.

### Qvod (Kuaibo)

Among all failed products, the most sigh-inducing might be Qvod. In April 2014, Qvod servers closed, and related personnel were sentenced. As for why it failed and was sentenced, I won't say much—those who know, know. Qvod was indeed innovative technically, just used in the wrong place.

## In Conclusion

There are other websites like Mobile's Fetion, Xiami Music, Tianya Community, etc., that I won't go into detail about. Behind each disappeared product are their own stories. Although they have declined, the marks they left in internet development history are indelible, and they carry our generation's youth.

Although this project is simple, it demonstrates an important application scenario of AI programming—rapidly realizing creative ideas. When you have a good idea, you don't need to spend a lot of time learning complex technologies; you only need to use AI tools to turn ideas into reality in a short time.

I hope this case gives you some inspiration, making you realize that AI programming can not only be used for serious commercial projects, but also to realize various interesting creative ideas. Maybe the next hit creative application will be made by you?

Did these websites above trigger your memories? Which product do you think is the most regrettable? Welcome to leave a comment and share~
