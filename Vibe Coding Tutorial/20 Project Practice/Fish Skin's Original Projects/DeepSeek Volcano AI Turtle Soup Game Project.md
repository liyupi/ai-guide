# DeepSeek + Volcano - AI Turtle Soup Game Project Practice

This project is an AI Turtle Soup game website where you play Turtle Soup games through AI conversation.

This is a rapid Vibe Coding practical project that took just over 2 hours from requirements analysis to development completion. The frontend uses AI generation, while the backend is handwritten to call the AI API. The focus is on learning rapid development workflows, Prompt prompt engineering, and methods for adding AI capabilities to programs.

Project code is free and open source: https://github.com/liyupi/yuhaigui-ai-game

Project text + video tutorial: https://www.codefather.cn/course/1898973113527894017

The following is an introduction to the completed project and demonstration effects.

Hello everyone, I'm Programmer Fish Skin. We're now in the era of universal AI, and we programmers need to find ways to squeeze every drop of utility out of AI. The other day, on a whim, I spent a little over 2 hours in a live stream, starting from requirements analysis, and led everyone through building an AI Turtle Soup game project.

[I've also open-sourced the code](https://github.com/liyupi/yuhaigui-ai-game) for friends to play and learn:

Let me briefly introduce this project~



## AI Turtle Soup Project

An AI-native project you can learn in just a few hours. By building an AI Turtle Soup game website, I'll guide you through rapid practical AI project development workflow, keeping up with the cutting edge of the times.

Many friends may not have heard of Turtle Soup (海龟汤). It's a game suitable for all ages, divided into the "soup surface" (the scenario) and the "soup bottom" (the truth). The host tells a story (soup surface), and players uncover and restore the truth of the story (soup bottom) by asking questions.

For example: A person invites friends to a birthday party. After blowing out the candles, he kills all the friends present. Why?

You can let AI replace the traditional Turtle Soup host. Players only need to converse with AI to play Turtle Soup games on their own.

The image below shows the AI-generated website. It could actually be optimized further to look even better~

Through this small project, you can actually learn quite a lot:

1. Learn standard enterprise project development workflow: requirements analysis => solution design => backend development + frontend development => testing => deployment launch (optional)
2. Learn how to quickly initialize frontend and backend projects
3. Learn how to integrate AI large models into programs
4. Learn how to encapsulate your own AI utility classes
5. Learn how to optimize Prompts
6. Learn how to maintain conversation context and pass it to AI
7. Learn how to use AI to complete code
8. Learn how to purely use AI to develop frontend websites

### Technology Selection

#### Frontend

- Vue 3: Suitable for rapid development of single-page applications
- Ant Design Vue: Mainstream component library, compatible with PC and mobile responsive design
- Vue Router: Frontend routing component
- Axios: Mainstream request library

#### Backend

- Java + Spring Boot framework
- MySQL database
- MyBatis + MyBatis Plus framework
- Hutool utility library
- Swagger + Knife4j API documentation combination
- AI large model integration, here using the currently very popular DeepSeek

### Business Flow

1. Player enters the page and clicks [Start Game] to enter the chat room page
2. Upon entering the chat room page, AI immediately gives a greeting (presents the story soup surface)
3. Next, the user can converse with the AI host
4. The user can actively end the game, or AI can proactively end it
5. Users can view past conversation records at any time

The flow is shown below - this diagram was also generated using AI:

## Finally

The complete live recording of this project has been released in episodes on the [Programming Navigation website](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jHy2EjdOZPJDN_Lrs7qAUA). In addition to the above project, I've recently added many AI features to the [Smart Interview Practice Platform project](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jHy2EjdOZPJDN_Lrs7qAUA) on Programming Navigation, such as AI-generated questions and solutions, AI mock interviews, etc. These can all help everyone add highlights to their resumes and improve job competitiveness.

Programming Navigation also has [over 20 project tutorials](https://www.codefather.cn/post/1797431216467001345) that I've led everyone through, taking you from 0 to 1 through practical full-stack project development. Many friends have gotten good offers using my projects, with rave reviews~
