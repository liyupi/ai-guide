# Vibe Coding Project Practice Guide

> Building real projects from 0 to 1


Hello, I'm Programmer Fish Skin, former Tencent full-stack developer, [AI Programming Blogger](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453) with 2 million followers across all platforms, and creator of 10+ self-developed products including [AI Navigation](https://ai.codefather.cn) and [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn).

If you've finished reading the [Essential Basics] content and successfully built your first web application, then congratulations — you've taken the most critical step in Vibe Coding!

But I guess you might have these questions in your mind now:

"Making a simple todo app is indeed satisfying, but that's still far from a truly usable product, right?"

"I want to make a more complex project, but I don't know where to start..."

"Looking at those cool AI applications others have built, I want to try too, but I feel lost."

Don't worry, these thoughts are very normal. This section is specifically designed to solve these problems.



## I. Why Build Projects?

Before answering "how to build projects," I want to first talk with you about "why build projects."

Many students, after finishing basic tutorials, start frantically learning various tools and technologies, but never build a complete project. The result is: they learn a lot, but feel like they don't know anything.

**Building projects is the only standard for testing learning outcomes.**

More importantly, in the Vibe Coding era, the barrier to building projects has dropped to an unprecedented level. You don't need to master all technical details, you only need to:

1. Know what you want to build
2. Be able to clearly express requirements
3. Know how to use AI tools to implement it

These three points, you've already learned in [Essential Basics]. Now, it's time to apply these abilities to more challenging projects.



## II. What Will This Section Cover?

The core content of this section includes **the complete project development process** and **various types of project practice**.

First, I'll introduce a proven standard development process, from idea requirements to final implementation, making your project development more organized. This is the foundation for building good projects, strongly recommend learning this part first.

Then, I'll walk you through practicing various types of projects. Starting with simple personal tools, like portfolio websites, todo apps, Markdown note apps, etc. — these projects are highly practical and suitable for beginners. Then comes popular AI applications, including chat assistants, writing assistants, image generators, etc., letting you master the core skills of AI application development. After that are more complex full-stack applications, like blog systems, Q&A communities, online stores, etc., learning how to handle frontend, backend, and databases. There's also WeChat mini-program development, the complete process from development to launch.

After finishing the project, you also need to learn how to deploy and launch. I'll teach you multiple deployment methods, from the latest AI automated deployment, to the most popular Vercel one-click deployment, to professional server deployment, making your project accessible to the entire world.

Finally, if you don't know what project to build, I've also prepared 100 project ideas for your reference — there's always one suitable for you.

Additionally, this section contains some extended content, like enterprise project development processes, more enterprise-level AI project introductions, and Fish Skin's original project practice tutorials, etc., which you can selectively learn based on your needs.



## III. How to Use This Section?

You don't need to complete all articles in this section — you can flexibly choose based on your situation.

If you're a complete beginner, I suggest first learning "Vibe Coding Project Development Process" to understand the basic methods of project development. Then start practicing from personal tool development, choose a simple project and do it. This progressive approach won't make you feel it's too difficult.

If you're particularly interested in a certain field, you can also directly jump to the corresponding chapter. For example, if you're interested in AI applications, you can directly learn AI application development; if you want to build mini-programs, you can directly look at mini-program development content. Each article is relatively independent and can be understood without reading previous content.

If you don't know what project to build, you can first look at the Project Inspiration Collection, which has 100 project ideas — there's always one that can spark your interest.

For students who want to study deeply, after completing basic projects, you can continue learning "Enterprise Project Development Process" to understand how real commercial projects are developed. Or learn [Fish Skin's Original Projects](https://www.codefather.cn/post/1797431216467001345), following complete video and graphic tutorials to build complete enterprise-level projects.



## IV. What Will You Gain After Completing This Section?

Through the study and practice of this section, you will be able to:

1. Master a complete project development process
2. Independently complete the entire process from idea to product
3. Accumulate at least 2-3 displayable works
4. Understand how to use AI to solve real problems
5. Build confidence and methodology for building projects

More importantly, you'll discover: **building projects can be this simple, this fun!**



## In Conclusion

I know, seeing the words "Project Practice," many students will feel a bit nervous. But believe me, with Vibe Coding's help, building projects really isn't as difficult as you imagine.

Remember what I said in [Essential Basics]? Today in 2025, it's the easiest moment in human history to learn programming. And building projects is the same.

You don't need to become a technical expert, you don't need to remember all code syntax, you only need to:

- Have something you want to build
- Be able to clearly express your requirements
- Be willing to spend time trying and iterating

These three points, you already possess.

So, are you ready? Let's start this exciting project practice journey together!

Keep it up, you can definitely do it! 💪
