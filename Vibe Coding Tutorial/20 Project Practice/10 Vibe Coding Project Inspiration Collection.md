# Vibe Coding Project Inspiration Collection

> 100 project ideas across multiple domains


Hello, I'm Fish Skin.

In this article, I'll provide you with 100 project ideas suitable for Vibe Coding, covering personal tools, productivity, entertainment creativity, learning education, social interaction and other fields. You can choose based on your interests and skill level.



## I. How to Choose a Project That's Right for You?

Before looking at project ideas, let's talk about how to choose a project.

Many students get excited when they see project ideas, but give up after a few days.

Why? Because they chose the wrong project.



### Three Principles for Choosing Projects

#### Principle 1: Start from Your Own Needs

The best projects solve your own problems. You'll use it every day, so naturally you'll have the motivation to keep working on it. For example, if you find existing expense tracking apps too complex, you can build a simple expense tracking tool. If you want to develop a study habit, you can build a habit check-in app.



#### Principle 2: Appropriate Difficulty

The project shouldn't be too simple or too difficult. Too simple and you won't learn anything; too difficult and you're likely to give up. A good standard is: you roughly know how to do it, but there are some technical points you need to learn. This way it's challenging but not completely overwhelming.



#### Principle 3: Quickly See Results

Choose projects where you can quickly see results. For example, a simple tool that can be built in a few days and used immediately. This gives you a sense of achievement and motivation to continue. Avoid choosing large projects that take months to see results.

### My Recommendations

If you're a complete beginner, I suggest starting with personal tool projects. These projects have simple functionality and a single tech stack, making them easy to get started with. Examples include to-do lists, expense tracking tools, Pomodoro timers, etc.

If you've already done a few projects, you can try productivity or learning education projects. These are somewhat more complex, involving more functionality and interaction. Examples include note-taking apps, online whiteboards, study check-ins, etc.

If you want to challenge yourself, you can try social interaction or entertainment creativity projects. These involve complex features like user interaction, real-time communication, etc. Examples include anonymous chat rooms, online games, content communities, etc.



### How to Validate Project Ideas

After having an idea, don't rush to start building. First validate whether this idea is worth pursuing.

You can ask yourself a few questions:

- Does this problem really exist?
- How many people have this need?
- What are the shortcomings of existing solutions?
- What advantages does my solution have?

If the answers are all positive, then you can start building.

You can also build a simplest version (MVP) first, implementing only core functionality, to see if it's really useful. If useful, continue improving; if not, cut your losses in time and change direction.

## VII. How to Turn Ideas into Reality?

Seen so many ideas—are you tempted? But how to turn ideas into reality?

1) Choose an idea

From the 100 ideas above, choose the one you're most interested in. Don't be greedy—do only one project at a time.

2) Define Core Features

Don't try to build all features at first. Define the 3-5 most core features. Other features can be added later.

For example, if you want to build a blog platform, core features could be: publish articles, browse articles, user registration and login. Comments, likes, follow, etc. can be added later.

3) Develop Following Standard Process

Follow the 5-step process from "Standard Development Process": requirement research, write PRD, write technical design, write AGENTS.md, start development.

This process seems troublesome but can greatly improve success rate. Trust me, spending 30 minutes writing documentation can save you several hours of rework.

4) Iterate Quickly

Don't pursue perfection—first build a usable version, then iterate quickly. Each iteration only adds one or two features to ensure each iteration shows progress.

5) Share and Collect User Feedback

After completing the product, share with friends or publish to social media, collect user feedback. Improve the product based on feedback to make it better and better.



### My Experience

I've done many projects—some successful, some failed. Failed projects usually have one thing in common: **wanted to do too much, ended up doing nothing well.**

Successful projects are the opposite—at first I only do the core features, then slowly add more after they're done well. For example, my "Learning Hero" Mini Program initially only had core Q&A functionality, later added user statistics and other features.

So my recommendation is: **start small, iterate quickly, continuously improve**. Don't think of building a perfect product in one go—that's unrealistic.



### Get Inspiration from AI Application Platforms

Besides these ideas, you can also get inspiration from works collections on major AI application development platforms. These platforms have many user-created apps that can provide you with new ideas.

Recommended platforms:

1. OpenAI GPTs Store

On [ChatGPT GPTs](https://chat.openai.com/gpts) you can see various user-created GPT applications covering writing, programming, design, education and other fields. You can experience these applications and see which features can be implemented as webpages or Mini Programs.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260112125511653.png)

2. Doubao AI Application Platform

Doubao's [Application Generation Platform](https://www.doubao.com/code/chat) and [Creation Plaza](https://www.doubao.com/code/launch) have many creative applications. Most of these are quickly generated with AI and can provide good references. You can see what others are doing and which apps are popular to find your direction.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260112125557162.png)

There are many similar platforms like Character.AI, etc., that can also serve as inspiration sources.

But note, reference is not plagiarism—you need to learn and innovate. After seeing good ideas, think about how to do better and add your own characteristics for more chance of success.



## In Conclusion

That's all for sharing—I hope you can find a project you're truly interested in from these 100 ideas, then build it using Vibe Coding. Don't worry about not being good enough, don't fear failure. Every project, whether successful or failed, will help you grow.

**Most importantly, enjoy the creation process.**

Turning ideas into reality with code is itself a very cool thing.

Start your creation journey—go for it! 🛫
