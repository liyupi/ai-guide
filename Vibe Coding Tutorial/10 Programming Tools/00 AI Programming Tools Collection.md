# AI Programming Tools Collection

> Choose the AI programming tool that suits you



Hello, I'm Programmer Fish Skin, former Tencent full-stack developer, [AI Programming Blogger](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453) with 2 million followers across platforms, and creator of 10+ self-developed products including [AI Navigation](https://ai.codefather.cn) and [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn).

If you've completed the [Essential Basics] learning and successfully built your first web application, congratulations - you've already experienced the charm of Vibe Coding!

But you might have these questions in your mind:

- Web AI generators are quite useful, but I've heard Cursor is more powerful - which one should I use?
- What's the difference between AI models like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini that people talk about online?
- Some tools are free, some require payment - how should I choose?

Don't worry, these confusions are very normal. Facing dozens or even hundreds of AI programming tools on the market, even professional programmers can feel overwhelmed.

This section is specifically designed to solve these problems.



## I. Why Understand Programming Tools?

In the traditional programming era, tool selection wasn't that important. Whether you use VS Code or Sublime Text, the code you write is the same.

But in the Vibe Coding era, **choosing the right tool can potentially increase your development efficiency by 10 times!**

Why do I say this?

Because different AI programming tools:

1. Have very different capabilities: some tools can only generate simple code, others can help you build entire projects
2. Suit different scenarios: some are suitable for prototyping, some for products, some for learning
3. Have obvious cost differences: some are completely free, some cost hundreds per month
4. Have different learning curves: some can be used immediately, some require a certain foundation

Choosing the right tool lets you accomplish more with less effort; choosing the wrong tool might make you feel "Vibe Coding is nothing special."



## II. The 3 Major Types of AI Programming Tools

Before diving into specific tools, let's first look at the basic classification of AI programming tools. Based on usage method and complexity, I divide them into 3 major categories:

### No-Code Platforms

Open in browser and use immediately - no need to install any software, no need to understand any code. Suitable for complete beginners and those who want to quickly build prototypes.

Representative tools: Bolt.new, Lovable, Miaoda

Advantages: Quick to start, WYSIWYG, automatic deployment

Limitations: Relatively simple functionality, may struggle with complex projects

### AI Code Editors

Requires download and installation, interface looks like traditional code editors but with built-in powerful AI assistants. Suitable for those with some foundation who want to deeply learn Vibe Coding and need to build complex projects.

Representative tools: Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, Augment Code

Advantages: Powerful functionality, high flexibility, suitable for large projects

Limitations: Requires some learning cost, not very beginner-friendly

### Command Line Tools

Chat with AI through command line in the terminal. Suitable for developers with programming foundation and geeks who love command line.

Representative tools: Claude Code, Gemini CLI

Advantages: Extremely high efficiency, strong automation, controllable costs

Limitations: Requires certain technical foundation, not recommended for beginners

## III. What Will This Section Cover?

In this section, I'll help you comprehensively understand every aspect of AI programming tools.

1) **AI Model Selection**

First, I'll introduce mainstream AI models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) to help you understand their differences and selection methods. This is the foundation for using all AI tools.

2) **No-Code Development Tools**

Detailed explanation of various AI no-code platforms and AI application development platforms, including tools for quickly generating websites, platforms for building AI applications, and AI agent platforms that can autonomously execute complex tasks.

3) **Professional Development Tools**

In-depth introduction to AI code editors, AI command-line tools, AI IDE plugins, and other professional development tools to help you find the development method that suits you best.

4) **Auxiliary Tool Collection**

Sharing practical auxiliary tools like version control, deployment hosting, MCP services, as well as my tool combination recommendations and practical experience.

Additionally, there will be some supplementary articles that deeply explain specific tool usage methods and reviews for interested readers.

Specific tool combination recommendations based on different scenarios and needs.



## IV. How to Use This Section?

You don't need to complete all articles in this section - you can choose based on your situation:

- If you're a complete beginner: Suggest starting with "AI Model Selection Guide," then focus on "No-Code Platforms" to get started quickly.
- If you want to learn deeply: Jump directly to "AI Code Editors" and learn how to use Cursor.
- If you have programming foundation: Check out "Command Line Tools" and try more efficient development methods.
- If you don't know what to choose: Read "My Tool Combination Recommendations" directly - I'll give specific suggestions based on different scenarios.
- If you want to deeply understand a specific tool: Read corresponding supplementary articles and practical cases.



## V. What Will You Gain After This Section?

Through learning this section, you will be able to:

- Understand the characteristics and differences of various AI programming tools
- Choose suitable tools based on your needs
- Master usage methods and techniques of multiple mainstream tools
- Understand how to combine multiple tools to improve efficiency
- Build your own toolbox and development workflow
- Master essential skills like version control and project deployment

Choosing the right tool can really make your development efficiency soar!🛫



## In Conclusion

I know, facing so many tools, you might feel a bit overwhelmed.

Remember what I said in [Essential Basics]? Tools are just means - what you want to do is what's important.

So don't get hung up on "which tool is best," but think "which tool is most suitable for my current needs."

In this section, I'll help you sort out the context of these tools in the most down-to-earth way, enabling you to confidently choose and use them.

Keep going, future Vibe Coding master!💪
