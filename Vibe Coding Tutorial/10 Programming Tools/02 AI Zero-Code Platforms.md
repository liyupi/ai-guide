# AI Zero-Code Platforms

> Open your browser and start building apps - the simplest way to do Vibe Coding



Hello, I'm Programmer Fish Skin.

If you're a complete beginner with zero foundation, or just want to quickly validate an idea, then **zero-code platforms** are absolutely your best choice.

Why do I say this?

Because zero-code platforms have 3 huge advantages:

1. No need to install any software: Just open your browser and use it
2. No need to understand any code: Just describe in natural language
3. WYSIWYG: See results immediately after changes, with one-click deployment

In this article, I'll introduce several mainstream zero-code platforms, focus on explaining the domestic Baidu Miao platform, and teach you how to choose and use them.



## I. What is a Zero-Code Platform?

Before introducing specific tools, let's first clarify: What is a zero-code platform?

Simply put, **a zero-code platform is an AI programming tool you can open and use directly in your browser.**

You just need to describe requirements in natural language, and AI will help you generate a complete application with real-time preview and modification capabilities.

The difference from traditional development:

Isn't that much simpler? This is the charm of zero-code platforms.



### What Scenarios Are They Suitable For?

Zero-code platforms are especially suitable for:

- Complete beginners: Haven't learned programming yet, want to get started quickly
- Rapid prototyping: Need to quickly validate an idea
- Simple applications: Building personal websites, landing pages, simple tools
- Learning experience: Want to first experience the feel of Vibe Coding

Of course, zero-code platforms also have limitations. For particularly complex projects, you may still need to use a code editor. But for most scenarios, zero-code platforms are already powerful enough.

After understanding the basic concept of zero-code platforms, next I'll introduce several mainstream platforms in detail. Each platform has its own characteristics and advantages. I'll use practical examples to demonstrate their usage methods and help you find the one that suits you best.



## II. Bolt.new - Ultra-Fast Prototyping Tool

Bolt.new is one of the hottest zero-code platforms currently, launched by StackBlitz. Its biggest feature is **speed** - from idea to seeing results might take just 1 minute.

Bolt.new's core advantages:

1. Extremely fast: Both code generation and preview are very fast
2. Real-time preview: See changes as you make them, WYSIWYG
3. One-click deployment: Supports deployment to platforms like Netlify
4. Auto-fix: AI automatically detects and fixes errors



### How to Use Bolt.new?

> 💡 We already learned how to use Bolt.new in the [Essential Basics] quick start tutorial, so you can skip this part.

Using Bolt.new is very simple. Let me demonstrate with a practical example. Suppose I want to make a simple Pomodoro timer.

Steps:

1) Open the [website](https://bolt.new) and enter your requirements in the dialog box:

```
Please help me make a Pomodoro timer with:
- Default 25-minute countdown
- Start, pause, and reset buttons
- Alert sound when time is up
- Clean and modern interface
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107110501086.png)

2) Wait for AI to generate the code

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107110607536.png)

3) See the real-time effect in the preview area on the right

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107110658047.png)

4) If not satisfied, continue the conversation to adjust. Or use the visual editing feature - click where you want to change~

```
Change the background color to light blue, make the buttons rounded
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107110744960.png)

5) When satisfied, click the "Publish" button for one-click deployment, and you'll get a shareable link.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107111103207.png)

It's that simple! The whole process takes less than 5 minutes.



### Bolt.new's Pros and Cons

Bolt.new is suitable for rapidly validating ideas or making simple demos. It's very fast. The learning barrier is also very low — you don't need to understand code at all, just know how to speak. Plus, you can see the generated code if you want to study it for learning. Finally, deploying websites is simple — click a button to go online, and you'll get a shareable link.

However, if the project is particularly complex, like needing complex backend logic, database operations, etc., Bolt.new can still do it, but the effect might not be as good. Although you can adjust the website through conversation, for particularly detailed customization, it may not be as flexible as writing code directly. Also, you must use it on a web page, and the code editing experience is average.



### Pricing

- Free version: Has usage limits, suitable for trying out and learning
- Paid version: About $25 per month, removes restrictions

If you're a beginner, first experience it with the free version and feel the charm of Vibe Coding. When you're sure you want to learn deeply, then consider paying.



## III. Lovable - Full-Stack Application Builder

Lovable is a powerful zero-code platform that can not only do frontend but also full-stack applications: including frontend, backend, database, and even user authentication!

Lovable's core advantages:

1. Full-stack capability: Can build complete web applications
2. Database integration: Built-in Supabase, can store data
3. User authentication: Supports login, registration, and other functions
4. High code quality: Generated code has clear structure and is easy to maintain



### How to Use Lovable?

Let me demonstrate with a more complex example. Suppose I want to make a simple bookkeeping application that needs login functionality.

Steps:

1) Open the [website](https://lovable.dev), first log in with GitHub or email

2) Enter your requirements in the dialog box:

```
Please help me make a bookkeeping application with features including:
- User login and registration
- Add income and expense records
- Display total income, total expenses, and balance
- Can filter records by date
- Data must be saved to database
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107111601472.png)

3) Next, Lovable will generate a complete full-stack application, including:
   - Frontend interface (React)
   - Backend API
   - Database table structure (Supabase)
   - User authentication system

During this process, you may need to manually confirm some operations, like enabling Cloud to support database and user authentication:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107111715955.png)

4) After a few minutes, AI generation is complete, and you can test the functionality in the preview area

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112144754.png)

5) Continue optimizing details through conversation and visual modification features — the editing experience is quite good

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112259442.png)

6) One-click deployment online

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112411553.png)



### Lovable's Pros and Cons

If your project needs backend, database, and user systems, Lovable is a good choice — it can build more complex full-stack applications.

The code it generates is also well-organized. If you want to export the code later to maintain yourself, it's relatively easy. Plus, it directly integrates Supabase, a powerful backend service, letting you easily handle complex functions like data storage and user authentication.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112431787.png)

Of course, because it's more powerful, it's relatively more complex, and beginners may need some time to adapt. Also, because it needs to generate more code (frontend + backend), it might be slower than Bolt.new.



### Pricing

- Free version: Has usage limits
- Paid version: About $25 ~ $50 per month

If you want to make a complete web application that needs database and user system, Lovable is a great choice. But if you're just making simple display pages, Bolt.new is enough.



## IV. Baidu Miao - Domestic Zero-Code Platform

Baidu Miao is an AI no-code application building platform launched by Baidu, and also one of the most successful zero-code platforms in China.

Miao's biggest feature is that it not only generates applications but can also directly commercialize them. It has built-in payment functionality (including WeChat mini-program payment), can be directly integrated and used without additional development. Moreover, the interface is completely in Chinese, making it especially friendly for domestic users.



### How to Use Baidu Miao?

Using Miao is very simple, just like other zero-code platforms:

1) Visit [Baidu Miao official website](https://www.miaoda.cn/), register an account and log in

2) Describe your requirements in Chinese:

```
Make an online reservation system where users can select date and time, fill in contact information, and submit a reservation
```

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112754177.png)

3) Next enters the development phase, and AI may confirm requirements with you through conversation.

If you want to make a commercial-grade project, you must communicate well with it; if you're just making a Demo for fun, you can skip the conversation directly.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107112932144.png)

Then AI generates a requirements document:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113021068.png)

You can manually edit the document, or immediately generate the application.

After waiting a few minutes, AI automatically generates the complete application, and you can preview the effect in real-time:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113641264.png)

5) Like other platforms, you can modify the application. Supports visual editing — the editing experience is quite good.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113743213.png)

6) When satisfied, you can publish directly and get an access link.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113853665.png)

7) If you need more capabilities, you can use plugins to extend functionality, like integrating WeChat Pay to charge

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107113922034.png)



### Baidu Miao's Pros and Cons

Miao's biggest advantage is Chinese-friendliness — you don't need to know English at all. Plus, strong commercialization capability with built-in payment functionality — you can directly make paid applications, with many successful cases to reference.

But based on my testing, compared to international platforms, the generated effect is relatively average, suitable for small to medium applications.

However, for domestic users, especially those wanting to make mini-programs or needing rapid commercialization in the domestic market, Miao is a good choice.



## IV. Other Zero-Code Platforms Worth Attention

## V. AI Application Development Platforms

Besides the zero-code platforms introduced above, there's another type of platform specifically for developing AI applications, like Dify, Coze, Alibaba Cloud Bailian, etc.

Their positioning is quite different from zero-code platforms like Bolt.new. Bolt.new is mainly used to generate ordinary websites and applications, while AI application development platforms are mainly used to build AI chatbots, AI knowledge base Q&A, AI workflows, and other applications that need AI capabilities.

Simply put, if you want to make ordinary websites or applications (like personal homepages, e-commerce websites), Bolt.new and Baidu Miao are enough. If you want to make AI applications (like intelligent customer service, AI assistants, knowledge base Q&A systems), you can try Dify or Coze.

![Dify developing AI applications](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1743561915955-ad27735a-c927-4207-b769-03fda32081b6.png)

These platforms all provide visual configuration interfaces. You can build AI workflows by dragging and dropping, making powerful AI applications without writing code.

## VI. How to Choose a Zero-Code Platform?

By now, you might ask: With so many platforms each having their merits, which one should I choose?

Actually, the choice is simple — mainly depends on your needs and personal situation.

1) Choose according to needs

If you're a domestic user wanting to make mini-programs or need commercialization, Baidu Miao is the first choice — Chinese-friendly with built-in payment functionality, and already has hundreds of thousands of successful commercial application cases.

If you need to rapidly make prototypes or simple pages, Bolt.new is fast and simple to get started with — see results in 1 ~ 2 minutes. If you need to make complete web applications with database and user systems, Lovable is the better choice with the most powerful functionality.

2) Choose according to personal situation

If you're a complete beginner (never written code), I suggest starting with Baidu Miao or Bolt.new — simplest and easiest to get started. If you have some foundation (learned some programming), you can try Lovable — more powerful, can make more complex things.

My suggestion is to start with Baidu Miao or Bolt.new, then gradually try other platforms according to your needs.



## VII. Zero-Code Platform Practical Tips

During the process of using zero-code platforms, I've summarized some practical tips to share with you.

1) Be specific with requirements

Don't just say "make a website," but describe in detail, like "make a personal portfolio website including homepage (large title + intro + avatar), project showcase (card layout), contact information, clean modern style, using blue color scheme." The more specific the requirements, the closer AI's generated effect will be to your expectations.

2) Implement in steps

Don't present too many requirements at once, but do it in steps. First make the basic framework, then add features, finally optimize details. This makes it easier to control progress and easier to discover and fix problems.

3) If you have a reference design, you can upload an image for AI to reference, which can generate UI that better meets expectations.

4) After AI generates code each time, be sure to test in the preview area. For example, click all buttons to see if functionality works normally, view effects under different screen sizes, enter some test data to see if display is correct. If you find problems, immediately ask AI to fix them — don't wait until problems pile up.

5) Before making major changes, it's best to save the current version. Most platforms support version history — if something goes wrong you can revert.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107114739910.png)

6) Finally, even if you don't understand code now, you can export and save the generated code. When learning later, you can come back and study how this code is written.
