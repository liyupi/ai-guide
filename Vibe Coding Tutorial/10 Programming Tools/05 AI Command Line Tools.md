# AI Command Line Programming Tools

> A more efficient and geeky Vibe Coding method



Hello, I'm Programmer Fish Skin.

In previous articles, we learned about AI zero-code platforms and AI code editors. As you use Vibe Coding more and more, you might encounter some special scenarios:

- I want to develop directly on a server, but the server has no graphical interface...
- I want to write a script to automate tasks, how do I make the script operate Cursor?
- I want AI to batch process dozens of files, but operating in Cursor is too troublesome...

If you have these needs, then **command-line AI programming tools** might be the answer you're looking for.

Command-line tools have no fancy interface, only simple text interaction. But it's precisely this minimalism that gives them ultimate efficiency and flexibility.

In this article, I'll focus on Claude Code, the hottest command-line AI programming tool, and share more command-line AI programming tools worth attention.



## I. What are Command-Line AI Programming Tools?

Before learning specific tools, let's first clarify: What's the difference between command-line tools and code editors?

AI code editors are software with graphical interfaces — you can see file lists, code highlighting, buttons, etc. Command-line tools run completely in the terminal, with only text input and output, and almost no graphical interface.

To use an analogy: AI code editors are like driving an automatic transmission car — with steering wheel, dashboard, various buttons; command-line tools are like driving a manual transmission race car — only the core controls, but faster and more flexible.



### Advantages of Command-Line Tools

Why do some developers prefer command-line tools?

First is speed — no need to load graphical interface, extremely fast startup, and full keyboard operation is more efficient. Resource usage is also very low — without graphical interface, memory and CPU usage are both low, so it runs smoothly even on average-configured computers.

Command-line tools are especially suitable for automation. You can write scripts to batch process tasks, or integrate into automated workflows — something graphical interface tools find hard to do.

Additionally, if you need remote development, you can SSH into a server and use command-line tools directly on the server.

Honestly, typing commands in a black terminal and watching code automatically generate is indeed cool.



### Who Are They Suitable For?

If you're familiar with terminal operations, pursue ultimate efficiency, need remote development, or like minimalist style, then command-line tools are very suitable for you.

If you're not very familiar with terminals yet, I suggest practicing with an AI code editor like Cursor for a while first, and when you have sufficient understanding of Vibe Coding, then try command-line tools.



## II. Claude Code - The Most Powerful Command-Line Tool

[Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) is the official command-line AI programming tool launched by Anthropic, directly integrating the Claude model. It's currently one of the most powerful command-line programming tools.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107153527087.png)

Claude Code's most impressive feature is its autonomous execution capability — AI can not only generate code but also automatically execute commands, modify files, install dependencies, truly achieving "say one sentence, project is built."

Claude Code has built-in security review functionality — it asks you before executing dangerous operations, preventing accidental operations. It can also understand the entire project's structure and context, and when modifying code, considers the overall consistency of the project.

Particularly worth mentioning is that Claude Code supports **Claude Skills**. This is an capability extension package prepared for AI. You can understand it as a handover document prepared for a new colleague, containing task execution methods, tool usage instructions, template materials, etc.

For example, you can create a `Company Code Standards Skill`, writing in code style, naming rules, comment requirements, etc. Afterward, code generated by Claude Code will automatically follow these standards, no need to repeatedly explain each time.

The core value of Skills lies in: humans provide professional knowledge and methodology, AI provides intelligence. This is a huge efficiency boost for rapidly validating ideas and building internal tools.



### How to Use Claude Code?

Let me demonstrate Claude Code's usage process with a practical example.

1) First, install Claude Code with one command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

2) Then execute the `claude` command to open the program. By default, logging in with a Claude account is required, and Claude Code has access restrictions for China region — directly accessing Anthropic's official website or using Claude's API might be blocked, really annoying!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1764145940075-ace6fd24-a09c-41c0-b400-1cffc394fc8a.png)

But no worries, you can change the AI large model API configuration behind Claude Code to a domestic large model's API, like Zhipu's GLM.

3) Go to the `{User Directory}/.claude` directory and create a `settings.json` configuration file:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1764146110361-06e13de5-7de4-4fc5-9533-3651447d5e19.png)

4) Modify the configuration file content as follows, remember to replace with your own API Key.

You can get an API Key from [Zhipu AI Open Platform](https://open.bigmodel.cn) — be careful not to leak it!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1764146125955-3029843c-26b8-4628-b2b7-a9d8abb2aef1.png)

```json
{
  "apiKey": "Your Zhipu API Key",
  "baseURL": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/coding/paas/v4",
  "model": "glm-4.6"
}
```

5) Next, you can use it happily. Run `claude` in the project directory to start the conversation:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1764146174167-3018c8f3-0ad9-4a4f-9764-246f33b33203.png)

6) Let AI make a practical image compression tool, prompt as follows:

```markdown
Please generate an "Image Compression Tool" website that implements image compression processing functionality. Need to include complete frontend and backend code, requiring the project to run normally.

Required features:
1. Support uploading and compressing common image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
2. Can set compression quality (like high/medium/low or custom percentage)
3. Display comparison between original and compressed images (dimensions, size, preview)
4. Provide download button after compression, support batch processing

Design requirements:
1. Modern minimalist style, main color uses green
2. Responsive layout, good experience on both mobile and desktop devices
3. Upload area has obvious drag-and-drop hints, intuitive and clear operation flow
```

7) After clicking execute, the large model quickly gave a task plan — first build backend, then implement frontend, frontend-backend integration, finally test and run:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1759250070544-7ede700d-37f2-4e4a-bfdb-01631f10df34.png)

In less than 5 minutes, AI completed the task, and even automatically installed dependencies for me, so thoughtful~

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1759250293957-36299a39-fff9-4e5d-a23a-299efd854938.png)

We open a browser and visit `localhost:3000` to see the effect:

During the entire process, Claude Code automatically executes commands, creates files, modifies code — you just need to describe requirements in natural language. So satisfying!



### Claude Code's Pros and Cons

Besides the autonomous execution capability and Skills support mentioned earlier, Claude Code has many other advantages.

For example, it supports multiple programming languages — not just JavaScript/TypeScript, but also Python, Go, Rust, etc. Project understanding capability is also strong — it can automatically analyze project structure and understand relationships between files. When modifying code, it considers the consistency of the entire project.

The downside is also known — Claude Code uses Anthropic's API and charges by token. For detailed pricing information, I recommend checking [Anthropic's official pricing documentation](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing). However, if you frequently need to develop complex new projects and write lots of code, Claude Code's efficiency is worth the cost.

## III. Other Command-Line Tools Worth Attention

Besides Claude Code, there are some other command-line tools worth understanding.



### Gemini CLI

[Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/) is an open-source command-line tool launched by Google, integrating the Gemini model. The biggest advantage is it has free quotas, and supports ultra-long context (1 million tokens), can analyze an entire large project at once. Suitable for developers who want to try command-line tools but have limited budgets and need to analyze large projects.

It uses ReAct (Reasoning and Action) loops — AI thinks first then acts, with relatively strong capability for handling complex tasks. Also supports MCP (Model Context Protocol), can connect to various external tools and services.

Usage is similar to Claude Code — one command to install:

```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

Then type `gemini` to run:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107154410787.png)



### Warp

[Warp](https://www.warp.dev) is a modern terminal tool — it's not just a terminal, but also integrates a code editor and AI assistant, three in one.

From my personal experience, Warp's interface is more user-friendly than Claude Code, supporting AI command suggestions and team collaboration features.

If you frequently work in the terminal but want a better interactive experience, Warp is a good choice. It lets you enjoy command-line efficiency while not completely abandoning the convenience of graphical interfaces.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107154658863.png)



### GitHub Copilot CLI

GitHub Copilot is an AI programming assistant launched by Microsoft, already used by millions of developers. [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli) is its command-line version, allowing AI assistance in the terminal.

It deeply integrates with GitHub, supports MCP protocol, can generate and explain commands.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107154809001.png)

If you're already using GitHub Copilot for code completion, then Copilot CLI lets you enjoy similar AI assistance in the terminal, especially suitable for scenarios that frequently need to execute commands.



### OpenCode

[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) is a recently very hot open-source command-line AI programming tool, called "the open-source version of Claude Code."

OpenCode's biggest advantage is **completely free and open-source** — compared to Claude Code, OpenCode doesn't require paid subscription and has no regional restrictions, making it especially friendly for domestic users.

It provides an intuitive terminal interface, session management, custom commands, and other features. Also supports free switching between multiple models including Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc. You can choose the most suitable model for different tasks without being limited to a single model.

If you want to try command-line AI programming but don't want to pay, OpenCode is the best choice.

Usage is simple — one command to install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

Then execute the `opencode` command to use it happily:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260107155212400.png)

This interaction is much more comfortable than Claude Code~

### How to Choose a Command-Line AI Tool?

Choosing a command-line AI tool mainly depends on your needs and budget.

- If pursuing the strongest functionality and best experience, choose Claude Code. Its autonomous execution capability, Skills support, and project understanding capability are all the strongest, suitable for professional developers and complex projects. However, it requires payment, and domestic users need to configure domestic large model APIs.
- If you want completely free usage, choose OpenCode. It's open-source, supports multi-model switching, functionality close to Claude Code, and has no regional restrictions. For students and individual developers with limited budgets, OpenCode is the best choice.
- If you need ultra-long context to analyze large projects, choose Gemini CLI — it supports 1 million token context, can analyze an entire large project at once, and has free quotas.
- If you need better terminal experience, choose Warp. It combines terminal, editor, and AI in one, with a modern interface, suitable for developers who don't want to completely abandon graphical interfaces.
- If you're already using GitHub Copilot, choose Copilot CLI — it can seamlessly integrate with your existing workflow.

Choose the most suitable tool for different tasks for highest efficiency.

I mainly use Claude Code + configured domestic models to quickly build small to medium projects, or perform file batch processing operations. Of course, as an AI programming blogger, I also try various different command-line tools, jumping back and forth.



## IV. Command-Line Tool Practical Tips

Whatever command-line tool you choose, the following tips can help you improve efficiency.



### 1. Make Good Use of Aliases

Set up aliases in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` to quickly start tools.

For example:

```bash
alias cc="claude"
alias gc="gemini"
alias oc="opencode"
```

This way you only need to type `cc` to start Claude Code, `gc` to start Gemini CLI, `oc` to start OpenCode. Although it's just a few fewer letters, for developers who use these frequently, it also saves time.



### 2. Create Project Configuration Files

Create configuration files in the project root directory to tell AI the project's standards.

Claude Code will automatically read the `CLAUDE.md` file in the project root directory — this is the officially recommended configuration file name. You can write project standards, common commands, core file descriptions, etc.:

```markdown
# Project Standards

- Use TypeScript
- Follow Airbnb code standards
- All functions must have type annotations
- Use ESLint and Prettier

# Common Commands

- npm run dev: Start development server
- npm run build: Build production version
- npm test: Run tests
```

This way, AI-generated code will automatically follow these standards. Plus, you can commit the `CLAUDE.md` file to Git for the team to maintain together, making AI increasingly understand your project.



### 3. Execute in Steps

Don't present overly complex requirements all at once — do it in steps:

- First create the basic project structure
- Then add features
- Finally optimize details

This makes it easier to control progress and easier to discover and fix problems.



### 4. Combine with Other Commands

Command-line tools can be combined with other commands. For example, you can save a command's output to a file, then have AI read it:

```bash
# Save git diff output to file
git diff > changes.txt

# Then reference this file in Claude Code
# In conversation say: Generate commit message based on @changes.txt changes
```

Or write scripts to batch process tasks, achieving completely automated development workflows.

For example, you can write a script to automatically traverse all files and have AI add comments, optimize code, etc.



### 5. God-Level Tips from Claude Code's Founder

Claude Code's founder shared some god-level usage tips — here are a few most practical ones:

1) Run multiple instances to improve efficiency: Run multiple Claudes simultaneously in the terminal, number the tabs, use system notifications to know which needs manual input. You can also run multiple instances on the web Claude Code simultaneously with local Claude, fully utilizing wait time.

2) Prioritize models with thinking capability: Although slower, they're better at tool use, leading to higher efficiency in the long run.

3) Team-shared CLAUDE.md file: Manage the file with Git, maintained by team members. Whenever you see Claude do something wrong, add it to CLAUDE.md so Claude knows not to do that next time.

4) Use slash commands to improve efficiency: Type `/` in the dialog to trigger shortcut commands, can customize these commands to encapsulate common workflows. For example, create a `/commit-push-pr` command to complete commit, push, and create PR all at once.

5) Use MCP tools to extend functionality: Like Slack search and publish content, run BigQuery queries, get error logs from Sentry, etc.

6) Improve feedback verification mechanism: Don't just let Claude work, also let it know how to verify its own work. For example, have it open a browser to test the UI, automatically iterate when problems are found, until the functionality runs normally.



## In Conclusion

By now, I believe you have a comprehensive understanding of command-line AI programming tools.

**Note: Command-line tools are not necessities, but a choice to improve efficiency.**

If you feel Cursor is already sufficient, you can absolutely continue using Cursor. Command-line tools are more suitable for developers who pursue ultimate efficiency, like minimalist style, or have special needs like remote development, automated processing, etc.

But I suggest friends who want to deeply learn Vibe Coding should try it — modern command-line tools are already very friendly, and as long as you know basic terminal operations, you can get started.

For domestic users, I recommend two choices:

1. Claude Code with domestic large models: Can use normally, costs aren't high.
2. OpenCode: Completely free and open-source, supports multi-model switching, no regional restrictions, suitable for students and individual developers with limited budgets.

In the next article, I'll introduce IDE plugins, teaching you how to flexibly configure your development environment.

Keep it up!
