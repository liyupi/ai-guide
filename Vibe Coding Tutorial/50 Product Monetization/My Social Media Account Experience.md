# My Social Media Account Starting Experience

> True experience from 0 to 100k followers



Hello everyone, I'm Fish Skin. Just came to X platform, followers already broke several thousand, honestly a bit surprised and honored, thank you everyone for fueling every dream 🌹.

Many friends ask how I did it?

Besides having some domestic platform influence before, more important is method, but this method isn't difficult, everyone can do it. And when I started accounts on various platforms, basically all did this way.

Watching followers rapidly increase, I remembered that time from 0 to 100k followers. Today want to talk to everyone about this part of story, and share some real account starting experience.

Whether you want to promote your products through social media, or want to build personal brand, this experience can help you.



## Starting From 18 Views

In 2020 during special period, I was at home remotely TX interning. One day opened Douyin, randomly flipped few videos, I discovered seems on Douyin, not many programmers doing tech sharing. Maybe because Douyin tends entertainment? Or maybe because short video limits, hard to explain a technology clearly through just a few words?

I'm someone who likes trying new things,正好 recording short videos cost also won't be very high, so I started my short video creation career after work.

Because during college I independently developed an interview practice product — Interview Monarch (yes, this is my now hundreds of thousands of users product - Interview Duck prototype), therefore first Douyin short video account called "Interview Monarch," video content focused on programmer high-frequency interview question analysis,正好 helping myself spring recruitment get more opportunities.

Truly making short videos after, I discovered things didn't imagine so simple.

First is production cost, making short videos isn't just simply using phone to shoot, record screen and done, besides topic selection and most basic content, many materials need careful crafting, like cover, title, tags, first impression, opening etc. I would first write draft, polish and verify content, then record video, result first video took three or four hours.

Effort pays off! Guess final views how many?

**I remember very clearly, one day down, views were exactly 18!**

I thought newcomer views would be relatively low, but didn't expect TNND so low!

Saying not难受 is impossible, but after all it's first video; and at that time my purpose very pure, just through sharing, **while helping everyone also consolidate my own knowledge**.

Therefore, I didn't give up, also persistently insisted for about a month, updating at least one video every day, weekend would even update 3 videos!

Although each video views also only several dozen, but one+ month persistence, also let me harvest **life's first batch of followers**, about 100+, among which few dozen were my friends. Highest view video reached 1800.

So I really like number 18, it's very meaningful to me.



## First Viral Hit, Got Heavily Criticized

Later one day, I calmed down to think, does such persistence still have meaning?

So I went to watch many other classmates' videos, discovered often **real stories most touch people**.

So, I registered another new Douyin account, also current account [Programmer Fish Skin], and first time through short video platform shared my programming learning and job hunting experience with everyone.

Result, this time views and likes unexpectedly, second day woke up, messages already 99+, mood at that time still very excited.

But, when I opened comment section, mood immediately fell to valley. Comment section filled with various **doubts, disdain, even abuse**, many people saying "another marketing account born," also what "Douyin all are talents, make outsiders circle around confused."

Okay, I算是 know why this video could fire, although all bad reviews, but this **interaction rate** truly high.

Remember at that time had one scolding me comment likes also super high, almost approached my video likes at that time. Thinking about it now, really want to thank those friends who scolded me then, of course include current.

After this video, I started thinking, if sharing programming technology, can also change to more interesting, more cater to masses, more easily accepted way. Creation certainly can only care about self cool, but if can let audience also cool, isn't that一举两得?

So, I started sharing some quality, easy-to-use programming resources, and some programming little knowledge I accumulated. And during this period continuously learning short video creation techniques, learned to see data, learned to optimize various indicators, watch others' videos to learn good creativity and experience.

Still remember college computer class teacher said a sentence: 1.01^365 power equals how much? Daily change a little, also will have huge change, scary is blind persistence, without doing any changes.



## First Livestream, Aba Aba

Next, I tried life's first livestream, picture was one computer, remember at that time about ten+ viewers, **I didn't know what to say, also didn't know what these ten+ viewers watching**, I just kept repeating "Hello everyone, this is my first livestream," result also really had people keep watching.

Later, I persisted every night livestream a little while, through communicating programming with everyone in livestream room, I felt diverse lives, kept benign interaction with fan friends, also helped me harvest more followers.

And you dare imagine, I'm an i person (ISTJ), friends who watched me roasting company video should be able to feel.

Through unremitting effort, my Douyin gradually had improvement, followers and views both steadily growing. Although said Douyin is platform tending entertainment and life, but I here also owned a piece of my own small world, got to know many friends.

Persistence also let me see another change, is comment section below doubts and abuse towards me became fewer and fewer. Of course even now, still will have many people scold me, but this isn't very normal thing? I'm not money everyone loves~ seeing myself persistently doing things helped more classmates, got affirmation, this is enough.



## Multi-Platform Expansion

With Douyin foundation, I started trying other platforms, like public account and B站, all called Programmer Fish Skin.

When doing B站, I formally published first follower gain video I guess everyone also can guess. Right, is my own personal experience from learning programming to joining big company. Specifically gained how many followers I forgot, but印象 this one video basically brought account up. What I remember most clearly is, some little buddy discovered I'm a crooked mouth war god, hahaha.

But public account follower gain not so easy, at start I foolishly thought want gain followers, must write more articles, so set goal of 1 article per day for myself. Result quality not high, readership not high, followers also didn't grow much.

Very quickly, I realized going on like this would be disastrous, must change method!

So I started crazy mixing circles, communicating with successful predecessors, learning, imitating; find big accounts to contribute, strive for repost opportunities; open channels, publishing same article, same video to multiple platforms; use Douyin to bring traffic to public account etc. About my doing public account from 0 to 100k followers experience, later will share more detailed with everyone.

Just like this, total about 1 year, Douyin followers 78k, public account 18k, plus B站, approximately accumulated **100k followers**, first small goal achieved.

So seeing here, you should already know what account starting method I said at beginning is right?

Right, is **share real experience**.

From short video 18 views -> abandon account restart -> first small fire -> persist livestream -> expand graphics and long video, what I've been doing, is sharing my own real experience, real thoughts, real feelings with everyone.

This time coming to X platform, I saw just doing X friend @Programmer Little Grey brother through sharing real experience quickly gained many followers, this more firm my confidence in this method.

I think this is something everyone can do, doesn't need flowery rhetoric, doesn't need neat article structure, only need to sincerely share own story out good.

**Your experience is absolutely unique, as for the rest, leave to algorithm.**

Below I want to combine this experience, share some real social media account starting suggestions with everyone.



## Some Social Media Account Starting Suggestions

1) Real most important

Looking at self and entire internet observation, I discovered **more real, more natural, easier to explode**.

Doing good content, is everything's foundation. Real things in AI era will be more precious. Don't deliberately imitate others, your experience is most unique material.



2) Lower expectations, persist action

I know many friends will feel anxious because of traffic, feel things made have no one watching, no one recognizing.

But I want to say: **persist will definitely succeed.**

I just started doing public account, readership also single digits. But later I continuously 100+ days after work livestream until early morning, just this persistence, let me break through bottleneck.

Facing anxiety's best method is: lower expectations and persist action, I really like Speak Less Do More this sentence.



3) Interesting very important

For advanced programming technology or complete tutorials, people who truly want to see this content will proactively search, don't need you to turn text draft into video. Especially AI era came, some friends pursuing efficiency even won't watch long videos, but directly use AI tools summarized.

Suggest make content relaxed and interesting, let everyone in fragmented time understand new knowledge. Like I try to let every video can bring everyone some knowledge, even if "my server got attacked" this kind of hard to hold experience, believe also can let everyone step on fewer pits.



4) AI is only tool, core is your creativity

Now through AI + various workflows can quickly batch create content, although has opportunity to起量, but definitely has corresponding bottleneck, because simpler things, replication cost lower.

Key still must have own creativity and characteristics, just that nowadays achieving creativity cost became simple.



5) Immediately action

Many people ask me: "I also want to do social media, but don't know how to start."

My answer is: **don't just think, go try more!**

I myself very hate that theory faction, set after set, watched then forget. Instead is self practicing account process, will naturally slowly learn much knowledge, and impression more profound. Give example, get limited flow once then you know next time copywriting need to pay attention to which forbidden words.

Also how to write title, how to make cover, how to select topics, how to see data, how to optimize content, these all learned in practice.

Practicing to waste worst case just restart!

Like my first account "Interview Monarch" was practiced to waste, but that experience let me learn too many things, also is key to later new account起量.



6) Find accurate positioning, do what you're good at

Don't compete with some field's more professional teams. Like I at start wouldn't produce dozens of hours complete courses, because training institutions more professional.

Like my early period positioning very clear: share real experience + interesting technical knowledge + quality resource recommendations.

Find your own positioning, do what you're good at, this very important.

Speaking of this actually has one thing makes me very angry, I '21 ~ '22 period self made many interesting projects, result later discovered audience simply don't care whether project developed by you, useful / interesting enough, many times recommending self laboriously developed projects还不如 recommending others views higher.



7) Time management

Still remember before had one scolding me young guy, said I behind definitely have team, 1 person how possible do so many things?

But at that time truly didn't, I just used some time management techniques.

First my most ideal state is sharing discoveries and learned technologies from work, rather than from 0 starting sharing things I completely don't know.

Someone asked my time where from?

Actually to do social media, I gave up lunch break, gave up games, gave up many going out to play opportunities, also stayed up quite a few late nights. I estimate 90% classmates no time reason all playing games and replying messages (watering group), if don't play games, time definitely still enough.

And once you like me treat social media as interest and hobby, rather than task, gaining followers will become much easier.



8) Accept anxiety, enjoy process

Q: During account process will lack motivation?

A: Definitely will, at this time must find some stimulation for self. Mindset must follow fate, deliberate won't persist.

Q: You will have data anxiety?

A: Definitely will, I will often compare with others, also once doubted myself got limited flow (although until now I still doubt haha). But more times, what I pay attention to is still content itself, learning others' works' excellent places, narrow gap.



---

Finally, if you also want to do social media, my suggestion is:

**don't think so much, first publish first content, tell others who you are.**

Even if only 18 views, that is also a start, at least you planted a seed, right?

This time coming to X, such rapid followers for me not necessarily good thing, because here I still newbie, also ask various big shots to please bear with.

If you support me, then I will be very happy, thank you; if you DISS me, treat me as a stinky dog, then I also hope through later sharing break doubts. I will try my best here share more my unique content, hope can give everyone some inspiration, let's grow together! 🚀
