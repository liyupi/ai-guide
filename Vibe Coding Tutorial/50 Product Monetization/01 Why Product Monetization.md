# Why Do Product Monetization?

> Think clearly why to do it, so you can do it better



Hello everyone, I'm Fish Skin. Before making a product, we first need to ask ourselves clearly: **Why do it?**

Then comes how to do it, how to do it better.

This article, I'll use my experience making AI products as an example to share with you my thinking methods before doing product monetization. Hope to help you clarify your goals and direction before starting to make products.



## Benefit

Why make your own AI product? The reason is simple, one word: **Benefit** .

Benefit means gain, but benefit is not equivalent to money, but can be reflected in many different levels, including material, spiritual, emotional, etc. Like when I first did 2 years of free programming knowledge sharing, I didn't care about "material" benefit at all, more because of interest, because of the positive feedback of helping fans — that is, spiritual and emotional benefit.

Everyone also often hears the word **altruism** . Why be altruistic? Essentially it's also self-interest. On one hand, you get the satisfaction of helping others — spiritual and emotional benefit; on the other hand, it can also bring corresponding material benefit to yourself, killing two birds with one stone. So this is also a practice I personally quite advocate.

So I started thinking: What are the different levels of benefit for me in making AI products?



### Material Benefit

Starting a company, making products, definitely hope to earn rice (money).

Why make AI products? Needless to say, everyone knows AI is now a "typhoon vent," a trend bigger than mobile internet.

Unfortunately, at the beginning I didn't realize this. At that time I was still working at Tencent, didn't have much time daily to pay attention to AI, thinking it was just another gimmick hyped by social media. But by February - March, I realized something was wrong, because not only were domestic and foreign big companies making moves, my "ignorant" colleagues around me actually started chatting about AI, chatting about GPT?! Plus social media platforms had more and more AI-related viral videos, every day unexpected new developments appeared, I realized: Damn, opportunity is here!

So honestly, my resignation had some relation to AI. Although I had long planned to resign, AI can be said to have kicked me off the cliff edge.

Anyway, I'm very optimistic about AI's development, and **people who walk in front of the times** will inevitably get greater material benefits, so I decided I must **enter the AI game**!



### Spiritual Benefit

Besides material benefit, I personally pay more attention to spiritual and emotional benefit. Because I've always advocated a free personality, whether doing sharing before or doing knowledge payment later, these are fields I love. I don't want to pursue material for material's sake, putting myself in constraints.

And based on my observation of accounts that started programming sharing at the same time as me, if you don't inherently love something, but imitate because you see others earning rice, you might get some crumbs, but won't make it big.

And entering the AI game, continuously contacting and learning frontier knowledge itself, I feel "too cool"! I personally love trying new things and sharing. And frankly, the traditional frontend and backend programming tech stack and development experience I've accumulated so far are completely enough for me to make most products. I also really want to establish my place in a new field. And AI, for me, is a mysterious strange new field. In the process of learning and practicing it, I'll feel very satisfied — for me, this is spiritual benefit.

Think clearly your own benefit, then you can start further thinking.



## Question 1: Why Make Products?

Then how to use AI to obtain benefit? The answer is in the text above: **walk in front of the times**.

As long as you closely follow the times, walk in front of others, see opportunities others don't see, get information others don't get, then you can have benefits.

Some classic examples:

1. Do social media, share AI-generated text and images, open the eyes of those who don't understand AI
2. Do training, share AI series tutorials, lead those who can't play AI to understand AI
3. Make products, integrate domestic and foreign AI models, let more people use AI
4. Do research, understand the latest domestic and foreign technologies, write better papers



So among so many methods, why did I choose **making products**?

First from difficulty perspective, doing social media and training is what most people can do, just spend some time. Doing research we're not good at, so making products is relatively suitable.

Product definitions have many types, could be a series of courses, could be an application, could be some service. And I chose to make Yu Smart AI into a website, mainly because:

1. My experience in making websites is relatively rich, developing a website is very easy
2. Website is an information carrier with very low usage cost, facing broader audience
3. Website can integrate various different technologies and applications, has unlimited potential



From benefit perspective, websites face more users, can more flexibly develop applications, naturally have more opportunities. And continuously polishing a "infinitely possible" work also makes me feel very satisfied. Making websites is like raising a child, watching your own child run forward, gives great sense of achievement.



## Question 2: Really Do It?

Although I said a lot above, it only put making AI products into the **optional** plan list, that is, "can do."

But whether to really do it or not, still needs to be compared and analyzed together with other plans, determined by **weighing cost-effectiveness**.

This point is especially important for people with limited time. Ideally, it's definitely "I want them all," things that can benefit, as long as my tech is OK, I'll do them all. But reality is, being able to do 2 - 3 things simultaneously is already very tiring. So must make choices.

Like students learning programming, in the learning process will definitely encounter many "opportunities": enter lab, competitions, internships, part-time jobs, etc., also many temptations. But need to think clearly about your goals, ask yourself: At this moment, is doing this thing really my most cost-effective choice?

Returning to myself, arranging 2 - 4 hours daily for product exploration, can also invest 2 team students to assist in development, calculated down completing this AI product is completely acceptable; the benefit obtained is also immeasurable (after all, without trying, who knows). So might as well just try 1 try~



## Question 3: Many Similar Products, Still Do It?

Before I was going to make AI products, many students felt there are already many similar "shell" products online now, but why did I still want to do it?

1) Opportunities are still many.

Step out of your circle, through research I found, truly understanding and able to use AI is still a tiny minority. Many students might have only heard AI-related content on social media, but just a glance, most people are still "outsiders."



2) Is "shell" meaningless?

So-called shell is just because predecessors paved the way for you, these are resources gifted by predecessors, we should accept them. But it doesn't mean shell is bad, shell can't be done, rather we can't be satisfied with just shelling, can still add our own innovation points on this foundation, do our own things.

Just like doing projects, you can consider adding your own extension points on the basis of completing online projects, turning it into your own unique thing.

Additionally, many programmers do technology for a long time, easily fall into it, thinking technology must be awesome when making anything, but neglect that technology itself serves business, products themselves are for users to use. So even for the same type of product, there are still many opportunities for optimization and innovation in user experience, interaction flow, etc.



3) Resources are king

In this current environment, the vast majority of technology is no longer a difficulty, product innovation is also no longer a difficulty. To put it realistically, as long as you have resources and certain business acumen, seeing others' innovation points, immediately can copy and imitate, isn't that so?

In this situation, if I have certain early traffic, I can more easily survive the product cold start phase, use a bit more, and can stand out.



Considering the above comprehensively, I basically determined to make an AI product of my own. But before starting, still need to do one thing — prepare for the worst.



## Prepare for the Worst

This is my consistent style of doing things. Before deciding to do something, first leave myself a way out.

So what's the worst case for making AI products?

For example: earn no rice, waste time, mess with mindset, waste some traffic.

But, think positively, even if failed:

1. I won't go bankrupt
2. My system can stay
3. I can share this experience and lessons as a column with others
4. Accumulate a period of failure experience



Using a period of time to trial and error, I can completely accept. So, just do it!

The above is my thinking process before making products. Whether you want to use Vibe Coding to do personal projects, or want to make a product that can generate value, recommend thinking clearly about these questions first:

1. Why make this product? (Benefit analysis)
2. Really do it? (Weigh cost-effectiveness)
3. Are there similar products? Still do it? (Competition analysis)
4. What's the worst case? (Risk assessment)

After thinking clearly about these questions, you'll find your goals clearer, more motivated to do it.

In the Vibe Coding era, the threshold for making products is already very low. As long as you have ideas, are willing to try, you can definitely make something valuable.

Go for it, look forward to seeing your product! 💪
