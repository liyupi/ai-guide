# Product Monetization Guide

> From idea to revenue, make your product truly generate value



Hello, I'm Fish Skin the programmer, former Tencent full-stack developer, [AI programming blogger](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453) with 2 million followers across the internet, and creator of 10+ self-developed products like [AI Navigation](https://ai.codefather.cn) and [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn).

If you've finished learning the previous content and successfully made some projects, then congratulations, you already have the ability to turn ideas into products.

But you might now have these questions in mind:

- The thing I made is pretty good, but how can I make it generate value?
- I want more people to use my product, but don't know where to start...
- Seeing others' products making money, I also want to try, but feel clueless where to begin.

These thoughts are very normal. This section is specifically designed to solve these problems.



## I. Why Learn Product Monetization?

Many students, after finishing projects, just throw the code on GitHub, then continue learning new technologies and making new projects. The result is: made many projects, but none truly generated value.

**Monetization is an important standard for testing product value.**

More importantly, in the Vibe Coding era, the threshold for making products has dropped to an unprecedented level. You don't need to master all business knowledge, only need to:

1. Know what problem your product can solve
2. Understand basic product operation methods
3. Know how to use appropriate ways to make the product generate value

These three points, through learning this section, you can all master.



## II. What Will This Section Cover?

The core content of this section includes **the complete product development process** and **practical experience in product monetization**.

### Main Content (Recommend learning in order)

First, I'll start from product monetization thinking, helping you understand why to make products, how to think about product value. This is the foundation for making good products, strongly recommend learning this part first.

Then, I'll take you through understanding the complete product development process, including requirement analysis, documentation沉淀, technology selection, architecture design, R&D process, etc. These are all practical experiences I accumulated during Tencent and entrepreneurship.

Next is the core content of product monetization, including profit model design, pricing strategy design, etc., letting you understand how to make products truly generate revenue.

Finally is an important part of product promotion, SEO search engine optimization, teaching you how to let more people discover your product.



### Side Content (Optional learning)

Besides the main content, I've also prepared some practical experience sharing:

- Website data protection practice: how to prevent websites from malicious crawler attacks
- System monitoring and alerting practice: how to discover and handle system problems in time
- Website data analysis practice: how to optimize products through data analysis
- My social media account starting experience: how to start social media from 0
- My social media growth operation journey: my real experience from 0 to 2 million followers

These content are all my real experiences in actually making products. You can selectively learn according to needs.



## III. How to Use This Section?

The articles in this section are divided into main and side content. You can flexibly choose according to your situation.

If you're a complete beginner, I recommend first learning the main content in order, understanding the basic methods of product development and monetization. Then selectively learn side content according to your needs.

If you're particularly interested in a certain field, you can also jump directly to the corresponding chapter. For example, if you want to understand how to prevent websites from being attacked, you can directly look at website data protection practice; if you want to learn social media operation, you can directly look at social media related content. Each article is relatively independent and can be understood without reading previous content.

If you already have your own product and want it to generate value, you can focus on learning profit model design, pricing strategy design, SEO optimization, etc.

For students who want to learn deeply, recommend finishing both main and side content, so you can have a comprehensive understanding of product monetization.



## IV. What Can You Gain?

Through learning and practicing this section, you will be able to:

1. Establish product monetization thinking mode
2. Master the complete product development process
3. Understand various product profit models
4. Learn to design reasonable pricing strategies
5. Master basic product promotion methods
6. Accumulate practical experience and avoid common pits

After learning, you'll discover: **originally making products generate value can be this simple!**



## In Conclusion

I know, seeing the words "product monetization," many students will feel a bit utilitarian. But with Vibe Coding's help, doing product monetization really isn't as difficult as you imagine.

Remember what I said in "Basic Must-Read"? Today is the easiest moment in human history to learn programming. And doing product monetization is the same.

You don't need to become a business expert, don't need many resources, you only need to:

- Have a product that can solve problems
- Be able to clearly express the product's value
- Be willing to spend time trying and optimizing

These 3 points, you already possess.

Let's start this exciting product monetization journey together!
