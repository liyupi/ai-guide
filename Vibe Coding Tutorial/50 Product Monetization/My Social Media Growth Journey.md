Hello everyone, I'm Fish Skin. '98 little brother, previously full-stack developer at Tencent, now AI programming knowledge blogger with 2 million followers across the internet + entrepreneur.

In this article, I want to talk to everyone about my experience over these 9 years: from self-teaching programming in college → girlfriend ran off with someone else → entering Tencent → quitting to start business → doing social media from 0 to 2 million followers → product bankruptcy → company products with over 1 million monthly active users. There are highlight moments, also darkest moments; there are successful experiences, also bloody lessons.

Then this article should give you some inspiration.

If you've never heard of me before, or only started following halfway through, then just right, let me tell you a true story from ordinary programmer to social media entrepreneur.



## My Story

### College: Girlfriend Left, But I Got First Place

After entering college in 2016, I started self-teaching Java, frontend, Python, Go and other various programming technologies.

At that time, I was truly a grind king. Attending class during the day, soaking in the library coding at night, returning to dorm in the early morning was normal. As studio leader, I led a team building dozens of websites for the school, used the money earned to buy my first monitor, that feeling of earning money through my own "craftsmanship," really cool.

But the price was also heavy.

Long-term high-intensity study + staying up late, my gut had problems, for a period couldn't eat food, could only rely on hamburger and fried chicken takeout to get by. Even worse, girlfriend because I didn't accompany her every day, only cared about coding, finally ran off with someone else.

That period was really painful, I even doubted whether all this grinding was worth it.

But since choosing this path, there was no turning back. I continued burying my head and working hard, finally with major first place results got national scholarship, Challenge Cup competition national award and Shanghai special prize, Shanghai outstanding graduate. Junior year also published textbook "Blockchain Smart Contract Technology and Application" with teacher.

Thinking about it now, that feeling of going all out for one goal, really pure. Although lost a lot, also gained more.



### Tencent: 211 Undergraduate's Counterattack Among Tsinghua Peking University Pile

In '19 campus recruitment, I got offers from multiple big companies, finally chose Tencent.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/IMG_20210520_102141%E4%B8%AD.jpeg)

Honestly, pressure was very large at that time. I'm just 211 undergraduate, interns around me all Tsinghua Peking University Fudan Jiaotong big shots, academic background, background both stronger than me. Remember first company internal closed training, when I introduced my education, everyone's eyes looking at me like looking at a "stinky dog."

But I didn't lose confidence, since couldn't compete on education, then compete on time, compete on effort. Others off work, I still at company studying internal documents; others weekend out playing, I researching project code. Those most grind days, because studying too late no subway, I even bought a folding cot, directly lived at company.

Effort pays off, I finally passed conversion defense with group first place results, and won SSP highest level offer.

Working at Tencent nearly 4 years, I led BI project R&D, participated in big data R&D, once won Tencent internal application development competition champion, 5-star outstanding employee, promotion green channel. Working two and half years already served as new mentor.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/-33f2aa793b0cc6e2.jpg)

After just starting work, I used earned money to buy a TV for home, buy foot massager for parents. That moment, I felt all the effort was worth it.



### Social Media: From Douyin 18 Views to 2 Million Followers Across Internet

My earliest social media attempt was doing short videos.

That was during pandemic, I opened an account on Douyin called "Interview Monarch," specially sharing programmer interview questions. First video I made three or four hours, result views only exactly 18!

Although打击很大, I didn't give up, persistently insisted for more than a month, updating at least one video every day. Highest view video reached 1800, gained life's first batch of 100+ followers.

Later I changed approach, registered new account [Programmer Fish Skin], sharing my own true experience. Result second day woke up, messages 99+, I super excited!

But opening comments section, mood immediately fell to valley: all doubts, disdain, even abuse. "Another marketing account," "deceptive right"... those bad comments likes almost approached my video likes.

At that time my psychological quality wasn't strong enough, just deleted the comments. Thinking about it now, really want to thank those friends who scolded me then, because interaction rate truly high (laugh).

In '20 National Day period, I made another decision.

That day I just finished playing games, nothing to do. After entering Tencent one year, I discovered myself seemed already too lazy to do things outside work, every day after work still consuming energy in game world muddling along.

I thought, is there some external force, can let me reignite college time struggle passion?

Thinking of this, I was too lazy to even sell game equipment, immediately opened public account "Programmer Fish Skin," wrote first article.

**From that day on, I had no time to sell game equipment anymore.**

At first I foolishly thought to gain followers, must write more articles, so set goal of 1 article per day for myself. With basically no followers, forcedly produced dozen+ articles, quality not high, readership not high, followers didn't grow much either.

Very quickly, I realized going on like this would be disastrous, must change method!

So I started mixing circles, communicating with successful predecessors, learning, imitating; opening channels, publishing same article, same video to multiple platforms; even life's first livestream, ten+ viewers, I didn't know what to talk about, just kept repeating "Hello everyone, this is my first livestream."

**Most ruthless was, I once continuously 100+ days, every day after work livestream until early morning taking everyone to code.**

Honestly, pressure very large. Heard being programmer easy to lose hair, social media easy to lose hair, then these two together isn't hair like rain? My hair was truly continuously crying!

But I believe: Seemingly one person's explosive is accidental, for knowledge creators, more is **厚积薄发**. People with substance, just have substance, only need to flip a switch, radiance will bloom.

Just like that, relying on persistence and dead grinding, until now cumulatively created nearly thousand, ten million words, across internet accumulated 2 million+ attention.

Later comment section doubts and abuse became fewer and fewer, even到现在 rarely see bad reviews anymore. Sometimes I still miss those days of being scolded, after all interaction rate truly high (kidding).

### Knowledge Payment: 3 Years From Doubt to Recognition

In '22, I opened knowledge payment circle, which is current [Programming Navigation](https://codefather.cn).

At start had many doubts, I completely could understand. But I persisted, because I didn't want to do that kind of harvest wave of fans, earn bucket of gold then no longer maintain content, conscience would hurt.

These 3 years, I took everyone to make dozen+ complete original project tutorials, including AI application development, microservices architecture, high concurrency systems, wheel projects etc. Many projects were 100k+ word text tutorials + dozens of hours video explanation, during period also published project practice tutorial books, I was truly doing this with heart.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/mmexport1730163221798_edit_1144980604320076.png)

Many classmates through these projects study, successfully got big company offers. Every time seeing everyone landing news, I truly super happy.

Now [Programming Navigation](https://codefather.cn/) has already become one of domestic largest programming learning exchange circles, cumulatively helped hundreds of thousands of programmer friends improve technology and project abilities.

### Entrepreneurship: From 50k Users to Bankruptcy, Only Took One Month

In '23, I made most important decision in life: quit to start business.

Reasons have 2:

1) AI trend arrived, I wanted to try

2) At company growth space limited, I wanted to do things I'm interested in.

At that time company like a cage, trapped me this little bird. I had many ideas, but work occupied my every day majority of time, even had colleagues report me doing social media.

I didn't want to be constrained, I wanted to do things I love.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/IMG_20230406_144451%E4%B8%AD.jpeg)

That year 24 years old, I formed a 4 person small team, with zero experience situation, started a difficult entrepreneurship journey.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/IMG_20230628_230332%E4%B8%AD.jpeg)

**Honestly, entrepreneurship these two+ years, I experienced打击 before 20+ years of life never had, even bigger than college entrance exam failure.**

At start, I enthusiasm high, confidence full. Led only one frontend classmate from 0 made an AI assistant platform "Fish Smart AI," took about one month to launch.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20251217144043123.png)

Result very smooth, launched one week users broke 50k! I started fantasizing I could become "Li" Gates, even took colleagues to Beijing for team building outing.

**But change came too suddenly.**

Only one month later, product went bankrupt, couldn't make ends meet!

AI products got banned, similar products crazy internal competition, early stage gave away lots of members got harvested... This gave me heavy blow, after all this was company's first product, product made for so long, product given so much hope, suddenly went bankrupt.

All say embrace change, I damn can't embrace it!!!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/Videoframe_20250306_141255_com.huawei.photos%E5%A4%A7.jpeg)

Later I calmed down, realized without stable team situation, pursuing爆款 price too large,不如踏踏实实 do things with long-term value.

So we started making various tool products: [Old Fish Resume](https://www.laoyujianli.com/), [Code Cheat Sheet](https://codecopy.cn/), [Clip Assistant](https://jianqiezhushou.com/), [Interview Duck](https://www.mianshiya.com/) etc. Meanwhile continuously improving Programming Navigation, took everyone to make dozen+ complete project tutorials.

**This period's pressure everyone might not imagine.**

Monthly huge expenses, team grinding, product iteration, market competition, malicious slander, internet violence, reporting, rumor spreading, fraud... These TV drama only plots truly happened to me.

Also body collapse. Long-term staying up late, livestream消耗 energy, irregular diet, high mental pressure, caused my gut often painful, even specially hospitalized did checks. Hair also fell super fast, directly show picture:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/mmexport1744270908127%E4%B8%AD.jpeg)

I recorded diary at that time, use one word to describe is "numb." Various things' mental pressure truly too large, like Sword of Damocles always hanging overhead.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/mmexport1730442587636.jpg)

No exaggeration, that period I emo days probably more than entire "first half life."

But I didn't give up.

Just starting entrepreneurship, I very much feared stepping in pits, fearing failure. But after experiencing more and more failures, I discovered myself actually kind of "addicted"! Because every failure, will have corresponding growth:

- Product bankruptcy, let me have more thinking about products and business
- Careless hiring, will let me more cautiously adjust hiring standards
- Contract breached, will help us improve legal awareness

Current me, more and more enjoy stepping in pits process, mindset also more stable. I often comfort myself: bro is here to pay tuition fees, even if company goes yellow in end, is also a unique experience right?

### Now: Seems Back to Origin Point

Nowadays, my own tech company Yuyuan Network, team already 10+ people.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/IMG_20241219_163148_edit_339910632357506%E4%B8%AD.jpeg)

After two and half years沉淀, we made Programming Navigation, Interview Duck, Old Fish Resume, Mian Duoduo, AI Navigation, Clip Assistant, Code Cheat Sheet, Algorithm Navigation, Frame Frame University etc. 10+ products. Among them [Interview Duck Practice Tool](https://mianshiya.com) now already has hundreds of thousands of users, our team various product matrix combined monthly active stable over 1 million.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/%E9%9D%A2%E8%AF%95%E9%B8%AD%E5%88%B7%E9%A2%98%E7%A5%9E%E5%99%A8%E7%83%AD%E9%97%A8%E5%85%AB%E8%82%A1%E6%96%87.png)

But interestingly, **I feel myself seem back to origin point.**

I every day still facing keyboard敲敲敲: writing articles making videos, writing programming and AI tutorials, learning new knowledge, researching requirements writing documents. You completely can't imagine this is what a team manager is doing, I often have soul travel to two and half years before feeling.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/IMG_20240131_104457_edit_1116282194475497%E4%B8%AD.jpeg)

Why still do these myself?

First, I just like writing something, making something, even if in others' eyes looks like blind折腾, I also enjoy it.

Second, I don't want to just be a manager, but hope maintain my own technology level, and continuous output ability. Even if one day company truly goes bankrupt, I also have ability to return to job market and compete with others.

And originally I also count as company founded based on personal IP, personal IP definitely is my foundation.

Now our team's work mode is: **I responsible for external output, team classmates do good delivery**. On one hand as own company project team member, with team develop improve products; meanwhile, continuously output quality content, bring traffic to own products.

I still continuously learning AI etc. cutting-edge direction new technologies, made own [AI Resource Navigation Product](https://ai.codefather.cn). Every day at least read 3 ~ 5 articles or videos to learn new knowledge, this is habit I've persisted many years.

Right, last year I also opened a script murder shop, now already went bankrupt, hahahahahaha boohoo ah... This segment enough to write into sci-fi novel, film as short drama experience wait until later share with everyone.

## Some Heartfelt Words for Friends Wanting to Do Social Media / Entrepreneurship

Since talked about social media and entrepreneurship, share几点血泪经验:

1) About cold start: Real most important

Everything hard at start. When I did social media, first batch of followers completely relied on heartfelt content, gained some big account repost opportunities.

From myself and entire internet observation, **more real, more natural, easier to explode**. Don't worry exposing true self will get sprayed, doing social media getting sprayed is very normal, from you start being UP主, should mentally prepare. Like I treat myself as a沙雕, you scold me you're right, who will be serious with a沙雕?

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/IMG_20251021_184310%E5%B0%8F.jpeg)

**In summary, doing good content is everything's foundation. Real things in AI era will be more precious.**



2) About persistence: Lower expectations, continuous action

I know many friends will feel anxious because of traffic, feel things made have no one watching, no one recognizing.

But I want to say: **persist will definitely succeed.**

I did social media so many years, never had truly explosive video, followers all from 0 accumulated episode by episode. I first started doing videos on Douyin, first video views only 18; doing public account, readership also single digits.

But I continuously 100+ days after work livestream until early morning, just this persistence, let me break through bottleneck.

Facing anxiety's best method is: **lower expectations and persist in action**. Treat yourself as a newcomer, from 0 start heartily create content, meanwhile continuously improve.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/%E9%B1%BC%E7%9A%AE22%E5%B9%B4%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C.png)



3) About content: Interesting > dry goods

Understanding audience psychology very important. Programming deep knowledge or complete tutorials, people who truly want to see this content will proactively search.

Should use relaxed methods, let everyone in main study time之余,零碎 time understand new knowledge. Anytime record inspiration, rather than forcing head write draft; remove nonsense, add some memes; when editing add some funny动图 and music.

My content quality control standard is:
- Fun, interesting
- Real, resonance
- Must leave something (knowledge point, a work)
- Concise,突出 main idea



4) About product: Quick validation, continuous iteration

Don't think of product too complex, **follow minimum可用性 principle**, first quick validation, continuous iteration.

My first product after entrepreneurship bankruptcy, very big reason was early development too ideal, led to giving away lots of members, got harvested, didn't control cost well.



5) About team: Learn to let go

Just starting entrepreneurship, I still kept independent developer thinking, myself write code, everything亲力亲为, many things carry myself, result exchanged was inefficient, anxious, confused vicious cycle.

**Learn to delegate work, liberate yourself, this is entrepreneur must cross hurdle.**

I spent long time to learn: focus on company's internal沉淀, especially workflow and standard documents. Two and half years, team沉淀 4790 documents! Also therefore I could have more time invest in creation.



6) About mindset: Enjoy stepping in pits process

Now I already realized entrepreneurship success must have traits: endless creativity, stable mindset and strong anti-pressure ability.

No matter how everyone views me, I'm doing what I think is correct, meaningful, makes me happy things, this is enough.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/IMG_20230405_113430%E4%B8%AD.jpeg)



7) Physical health most important

Remember before someone asked me: How sleep well? A financing tens of millions big boss smilingly told me: "Change a good pillow." At that time I didn't understand, now I already feel same.

But honestly, **body is revolution's capital**. Must eat breakfast, regular diet, less staying up late. I am living negative textbook, gut has problems, hair falls super fast.



## In Conclusion

Thank you for seeing here, this is my story. 9 years time, from self-teaching programming to Tencent programmer, from 0 to 2 million followers blogger across internet, to quitting entrepreneurship, products monthly active over 1 million.

I am Fish Skin, a still continuously折腾 programmer, a "grind king" who spends 90% time on study and work, an ordinary person who likes sharing, loves creating.

Although hair basically doesn't have much left, I still full of passion.

My motto is: Believe you have ability, then you truly will. Many times, limiting us isn't ability, but daring not to try. Current me, no longer fear failure, because every failure, is paving road for success.

Next, I will continue here continuously share interesting programming knowledge, practical AI play methods, social media follower gain experience, entrepreneurship bloody history.

**Future still very long, now following you are old followers already哦~**
