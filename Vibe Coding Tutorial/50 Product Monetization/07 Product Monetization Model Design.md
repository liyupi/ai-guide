# Product Monetization Model Design

> Powered by love isn't realistic, let products generate value



Hello everyone, I'm Fish Skin. Today the theme I want to share with everyone is **monetization models**, mainly hoping to give some monetization inspiration to website owners, software developers, content creators, team leaders.

Below I'll first introduce the concept of monetization models, then combine my own experience to share some common monetization models and thoughts.

Whether you're using Vibe Coding to do personal projects, or want to make a real product, understanding monetization models can help you make products generate greater value.



## What Is a Monetization Model?

We can break down the term "monetization model" into "monetization" + "model."

So-called monetization is making 💰变现; while model refers to adopting a series of methods or strategies.

Then combining the two, monetization model is easy to understand. Monetization model refers to: A series of methods and strategies adopted to achieve monetization goals. Simply put, it's "how to monetize."

Give a direct example, when I went out to hunt for food on weekend, I saw a fast food restaurant with booming business. For this fast food restaurant, its monetization model can be its menu and sales strategy.

It can make an attractive menu, like calling tomato scrambled eggs "Golden Color Blooming Red," then improve user satisfaction through unique recipes. It can run a series of activities, like buy 1 get 1 free, group deals, limited-time red envelopes, hiring a bunch of shills to queue, etc., thereby stimulating people's desire to consume, increasing revenue.



## Necessity of Monetization Models

After understanding what a monetization model is, I'll use some small examples to share the necessity of monetization models with everyone.

I started doing programming knowledge sharing social media in 2020, freely sharing knowledge for 1 year without income. Because I had no experience and not much popularity, I didn't consider monetization at all, purely powered by love. Looking back now, it's because my own self-drive and perseverance are relatively strong that I barely survived such a cold start period.

At the beginning, when some account owner friends asked me to take ads, I also refused. At that time I stubbornly believed: taking ads is betraying fans.

But later I discovered slow follower growth and also realized my passion was gradually fading. How to break through? No choice, let's try taking an ad.

The result? After getting the first ad, due to my own guilt, I would want to output even more high-quality dry content to "compensate" fans; and because of ad revenue, I was also more willing to invest more energy to produce content, just feeling like I was treating social media as my own career, having infinite motivation to make it big and strong.

Looking back now, I feel my choice was correct. I also saw many UP hosts who started at the same time as me, in the early stage under the name of being powered by love, later either gave up doing it or also started doing knowledge payment.

What fans need is your content, need you to bring them **continuous value**, this way can develop positively. Just like TV shows inserting ads, if there were no ads, TV shows wouldn't even have the chance to be seen, would the audience be happy?

If you want to make social media big, must have continuous motivation to update; and if you want to make a company big, also must have continuously accumulated resources.

Like me starting to do programming knowledge payment in '22, on one hand to give myself more motivation to help more friends learning programming, forcibly not letting myself be idle; on the other hand also want to accumulate resources for my future entrepreneurship.

Without early-stage resources, how to recruit employees? Without employees, how to make products? Without products, how to have stable profit? Without stable profit, how does enterprise survive, how to get bigger?

It's such a simple truth.

So, monetization models are necessary for enterprises. If we compare an enterprise to a car, then the monetization model is the car's engine, it provides power and support for enterprise operations. Just like an engine converts fuel into power to let the vehicle move; the monetization model converts products or services provided by the enterprise into profit, enabling the enterprise to continuously operate and develop.



## How to Choose a Monetization Model?

Monetization models can be as simple as a cup of plain water, or as complex as a specialty drink.

Because my experience is limited, I'll share some basic, mainstream monetization models with everyone, suitable for the vast majority of friends.



### 1. Direct Charging

Directly charge users a fixed fee in exchange for products or services.

Relatively common examples are software licenses (or game discs we bought when we were kids), you want to use this software, have to purchase its usage rights.

This model is suitable for providing products with **relatively fixed value**, must be extremely cautious when setting pricing, refer more to the market and comprehensively price based on your own product value.



### 2. Ad Revenue

Obtain revenue by directly providing ad display space to traffic owners or advertisers, is a monetization model with very low cost and risk.

For example adding an AI-related product recommendation position in our Fish Skin AI navigation page:

> This is just an example, in fact we haven't profited through this method yet

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20230717125736202.png)

If our platform traffic itself is relatively large and has its own customers, then don't need to go through advertiser platforms, directly communicating with customers about specific ad charging models will be more profitable. Like charging according to website daily visits * days * ad position value.

But if platform traffic is unstable and itself doesn't have an ad statistics system, suggest connecting to third-party advertiser platforms, like Google AdSense. Not only don't need to connect with ad clients yourself, but can also very flexibly configure ad positions, view ad effect revenue, very suitable for individual website owners.

Need to note, for a developing product, must balance ad quantity and user experience, weigh the ratio of ad revenue and user loss.



### 3. Subscription Model

Let users purchase product or service usage rights according to certain time cycles.

For example the vast majority of products use monthly and yearly membership systems, is the most common subscription model.

This method is suitable for products or services that update frequently and can provide continuous value, like knowledge planets, information subscriptions, etc. Need to cultivate user usage habits, improve user loyalty, otherwise might not be as effective as direct charging models.



### 4. Freemium Model

Freemium (free增值 model), refers to products first providing basic functions or free services to attract users to use, then realizing profit through paid增值 functions.

The downstream of this model might be direct charging or subscription models. The core idea lies in: first retain users through free services, then build user trust, cultivate user usage habits, then charge, conversion will be much better than direct "selling." Therefore this is also one of the most common models.

Our Fish Skin AI is this model, early stage consuming large amounts of cost to provide users with free services, equivalent to investing to seize users; later stage then converting and monetizing users.

But when using this method, must weigh free users vs paid users ratio, conversion rate and benefits, don't be like us and lose money in early stage from being harvested.



### 5. Commission/Transaction Fees

Platform acts as intermediary for transactions or services, collecting a certain proportion of fees from each completed transaction.

The most typical example is WeChat Pay, every transaction is equivalent to giving WeChat a "cut"; Knowledge Planet is also the same model.

The advantage of this method is low risk, large long-term returns, basically躺着获利 in later stage; but the disadvantage is providing intermediate service system construction needs cost, must guarantee service quality, and early-stage obtaining customer trust cost difficulty is relatively large.



### 6. Licensing Model

License your own brand, technology or intellectual property to other enterprises or individuals for use, obtaining licensing fees.

SaaS (Software as a Service) can be seen as a licensing model, providing software products deployed on cloud servers to licensed users.

Of course, the downstream of licensing models can also be direct charging or subscription. Relatively suitable for enterprises that possess unique technology or intellectual property and have relatively high unit prices.



### 7. Outcome Sales

By collecting and analyzing own product's outcomes, and selling the outcomes to other enterprises to obtain revenue.

Outcomes here can be website content, website data, website operation analysis conclusions, etc.

For example, a certain travel website definitely has massive user travel interest preference data, another company making travel products might want to purchase this data to improve products. Like some AI drawing websites, can also package exquisite AI drawings and sell to companies researching AI drawing models or some image display websites.

This model is suitable for products that possess large amounts of valuable data, general small products can't do it. But when we develop systems, must always have such a沉淀 awareness, keep all website data well, might have unexpected value someday.



### 8. Value-Added Services

Refers to providing additional services on the basis of original products or services, thereby increasing revenue sources.

Relatively typical example is Alipay, product itself provides payment services, but now you open Alipay and can see various life services like top-up, takeout, etc.

Like our Fish Skin AI website, also can completely provide AI technology consulting services as value-added services, just that our manpower is limited, so didn't do this.

Need to note, value-added services must match core products, rather than adding all kinds of miscellaneous services to the product, affecting user experience.



### 9. Partnership Model

A relatively advanced model, through cooperating with others, mutually letting each other profit, achieving mutual benefit and win-win.

There are many feasible cooperation methods. For example Product A provides job hunting services, Product B provides university student consulting services, these two products can completely mutually divert and recommend, increasing respective user bases; can also be Company A provides underlying technology, Company B provides upper-layer services, revenue sharing.

Need to note, choosing partners must simultaneously consider benefits the other party gives you and benefits you give the other party, establishing complete profit sharing mechanism. Because once benefits aren't equal, future cooperation will inevitably have conflicts.

Monetization model is the core of product monetization. Choosing the right monetization model can let products continuously generate value; choosing the wrong monetization model might make products difficult to sustain.

Remember these key points:

1. There are many types of monetization models, choose based on product characteristics
2. Can combine multiple monetization models, provide more choices
3. Must balance short-term revenue and long-term development
4. Must continuously optimize monetization models, adjust strategies based on data
5. Monetization models must align with user needs, can't only consider making money

In the Vibe Coding era, the threshold for making products is already very low. But, how to let products generate value and continuously develop, still needs you to seriously think about monetization models.

Go for it, find monetization model suitable for yourself, let products truly generate value! 💪
