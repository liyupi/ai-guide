## Why Create Interview Duck?

I believe friends learning programming all hate "八股文" (rote memorization questions) - those relatively rigid questions with fixed answers. But偏偏 **interviews always test these questions**, so friends often complain to me:

- These questions are too hard to memorize! What if I forget after memorizing?
- Too many questions, can't finish memorizing! Which ones should I focus on?
- Where to find these questions? The online ones are too messy!
- There are many questions online, but the solutions are too watery!
- Memorizing feels useless, still don't know anything!

Indeed, although there are many organized interview question PDFs online, they're basically "used for traffic generation" - either incomplete questions, not updated/maintained, or uneven solution quality. If you were asked to prepare for an interview now, wouldn't you first have to organize a bunch of interview questions yourself, then search for solutions online, then select the good ones? Just thinking about it is troublesome, takes quite a bit of time, and most importantly, you don't know if the questions will be tested or if the solutions are correct, right?

The world has suffered from rote memorization questions for too long. **Friends, it's time to crush some interviewers!**

So we launched the interview practice tool "Interview Duck" with more comprehensive questions, more convenient practice, more time-efficient memorization, better quality solutions, richer knowledge, and more frequent updates. These are Duck's 6 major advantages. Only one goal: **help everyone prepare for interviews in less time and crush interviewers**!

Think about it, how satisfying would it feel to encounter an original question you prepared for during an interview~

Below is an introduction to Interview Duck's advantages. I also recommend watching the short video introduction: https://bilibili.com/video/BV14E421w7dr/



## Interview Duck's Advantages

### 1. Four-Platform Sync, More Convenient Practice

First, Interview Duck supports **web version, mini program, IDE plugin, and VSCode plugin**, with full platform data synchronization, truly achieving **practice anytime, anywhere**, easily preparing for job interviews.

The interface is clean and very convenient to use. You can even secretly use it to search for questions during interviews...

Especially the "Immersive Mode" - one click to hide other elements on the page, fully immersing yourself in practice. One question after another, simply can't stop.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1768276245137-fb1ff126-5d7c-465d-8faf-bc99f7006b46.png)

The newly launched [Specialized Practice] and [Test Yourself] convert those high-frequency interview questions into multiple-choice questions, **specifically treating the "look and understand, ask and freeze" syndrome**.

Especially those concepts that are easily confused - which knowledge do you really master, what needs reinforcement - test yourself and it becomes clear. Regular practice like this also **helps you understand the interviewer's question-setting mindset**, making you more confident in interviews.

To help everyone happily slack off while practicing, we also launched Interview Duck IDE and VSCode plugins. Question banks and question lists use native UI display, **sufficiently covert**! You can also customize hotkeys, one-click open/close panel. Even Calabash Brothers' second brother couldn't discover I'm slacking off while practicing~

### 2. Comprehensive Questions, High Hit Rate

Interview Duck covers interview questions for **almost all mainstream programming directions**: Java backend, frontend, AI, Python, C++, Go, operations, testing, system design, scenario questions, company question banks, HR interviews, etc. **300+** question banks, **10,000+** high-frequency interview questions. Also includes fall recruitment hot questions, real company interview experiences, practice routes, etc., helping you 360°全方位无死角 crush interviewers!

We've categorized question banks by interview topics and positions. Take Java backend as an example, knowledge coverage includes:

- Java development: Java basics, mainstream frameworks, concurrent programming, JVM
- Backend middleware: MySQL, Redis, message queues
- Computer fundamentals: computer networks, operating systems, design patterns
- More extensions: SQL writing, system design, online troubleshooting, scenario questions, practical project question banks

Whether it's must-test questions for various company interviews, or unexpected niche questions, our question bank has them all. And **interview hit rate is super high**!

To better help everyone pass company job applications, we also added **Fall Recruitment Hot Questions** and **Real Interview Experiences** sections. Here you can see fall recruitment hot questions for Java, React, Go, Vue, frontend, backend, etc. You can also find real interview experiences from Meituan, Alibaba, ByteDance, JD, state-owned enterprises, banks.

You can practice according to your level and resume situation, grasp interview focus in less time, and experience the thrill of being asked original questions in interviews.

**Don't waste time organizing questions and searching solutions online anymore! **The time you waste, others could have memorized many more questions.**



### 3. Better Quality Solutions

We know everyone's efficiency in memorizing and practicing questions largely depends on solution quality, so we specially invited multiple **big company interviewers to create and optimize solutions**, ensuring solutions are correct and easy to understand.

Take scenario questions like "How to design XX system" - if you don't have similar experience, you'll be totally confused. We'll first provide **answer key points** for the question, striking the interviewer's weak spot, then combine with practical experience to give more **extended knowledge**, delivering a combo punch to the interviewer. For example:

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1768276824962-f8ecc421-0f5b-4e0d-b819-6a7c3767580e.png)

For just this one question, Duck wrote over 3000 words, accompanied by images to aid understanding, ensuring it's easy to understand. This way, everyone isn't just memorizing questions to cope with interviews, but **truly learning**, comprehensively improving technical vision, development ability, and interview experience.

Many of our solutions can be studied as technical articles and columns. So even if you're not in a rush for interviews, you can use Interview Duck to understand high-frequency topics, consolidate basic knowledge, clarify learning plans, and improve technical level.

For example, look at these questions below - can you answer them all?

### 4. More Frequent Updates

We're now updating solutions daily at high speed while optimizing system features. We'll also closely follow interview trends, continuously updating question banks and solutions, timely adding new questions, knowledge, and techniques from current company interviews, keeping you always ahead. Don't waste time on expired questions and knowledge.

Recently, AI-related concepts have been very hot🔥, and Interview Duck also added `AI Large Model Principles and Application Interview Question Bank`. Many questions are collected from real interviews at big companies. Pretty up-to-date, right~ And it's still continuously updating!

## Welcome to Experience

Hope everyone can try it and give us more feedback. For questions encountered in interviews or new content you'd like to see added, Duck will work overtime to answer them.

Visit https://mianshiya.com or search for "Interview Duck" mini program in WeChat to use for free!

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1727242691135-17601986-9d1b-4d85-a031-457867491597.png)

Currently all questions and question banks are freely visible, but some original solutions created by our big company interviewers are **members only**, since original solutions and system development consume significant human resources.

Just [open permanent membership](https://yuyuanweb.yuque.com/org-wiki-yuyuanweb-zvq1bg/oue2nx/tz028epsok1207t4) to freely practice all Interview Duck questions and solutions. Both PC and mini program are supported. You can also join the exclusive member communication group to ask questions anytime.

Simply calculated, if you prepare for interviews yourself, you need to search questions => organize key points => search solutions, and still judge solution accuracy. That's at least dozens of hours. Now with Interview Duck, directly start practicing high-frequency interview questions. If you have problems, you can seek help and feedback. How much time can you save? If you encounter an original question in an interview, pass the interview and get an offer, this investment is really trivial. And our solutions are carefully created, equivalent to learning multiple technical columns written by big company experts. Extremely cost-effective!

Currently Interview Duck permanent membership is **only 129**, and will continuously increase in price as features and content enrich. The expected formal price is above 399, so get it early and learn early~ We'll continuously update content and system features to give everyone the best practice experience. Thank you all for investing, and welcome everyone to supervise Duck's improvements. Since we're doing this, it's succeed or perish!
