# Programming Learning Roadmap Collection

> 100+ programming roadmaps, from zero to mastery in one stop



Hello, I'm Fish Skin the programmer, former Tencent full-stack developer, [AI programming blogger](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453) with 2 million followers across the internet, and creator of 10+ self-developed products like [AI Navigation](https://ai.codefather.cn) and [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn).

The biggest fear when learning programming is not knowing what to learn or how to learn. There are too many tutorials online, learning a bit here and there, resulting in mastering nothing, becoming more confused the more you learn.

To solve this problem, I created **100+ nanny-level programming learning roadmaps** on [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn), covering almost all mainstream programming directions, helping you systematically and efficiently self-study programming without taking detours!

Includes the currently hottest AI direction, [click to get codefather.cn/learn](https://www.codefather.cn/learn), and supports downloading learning roadmap PDF documents~
