# Programmer Efficient Work Skills

> Improve work efficiency and easily handle workplace challenges



Hello, I'm Fish Skin the programmer.

When mentioning programmers, many students who haven't graduated yet might think a programmer's work is just writing code all day. But after entering a company, you'll discover that writing code is only the most basic part of the work.

To efficiently complete work and quickly achieve growth and promotion in the workplace, there are many things and methods to pay attention to.

This article shares some programmer work skills I've accumulated at work. Everyone should find it relatively easy to read~

💡 Note: The following methods may not apply to everyone; these are suggestions only.



## I. Work Methods


### 1. Don't Rush to Work Before Requirements Are Clear

When I first joined the company, I had a fresh graduate mindset: my colleagues are all my seniors, and I must complete the requirements they give me as quickly as possible.

Plus, being new to the workplace, I had inexplicable confidence and felt some requirements were simple, so I'd just do them.

Then once I messed up - I thought a requirement was simple and told my mentor I could finish it in two days. After changing the code, when delivering to the product manager, I discovered I'd completely misunderstood his meaning. Then I spent several more weeks to finish the requirement.

Speaking of misunderstanding requirements, I think of a joke:

> Wife calls her programmer husband: "On your way home from work, buy a jin of steamed buns. If you see a watermelon seller, buy one."
>
> That evening, the programmer husband came home holding one steamed bun...
>
> Wife angrily says: "Why did you only buy one steamed bun?"
>
> Husband answers: "Because I saw a watermelon seller."



So everyone must remember, clarifying requirements is always the first step of our programmer work! Including clarifying the requirement's background, significance, specific functional points, etc.

If the product manager hasn't given a requirement document or provided enough information, you must ask them to provide a clear requirement document to ensure your understanding and goals are aligned before designing solutions and developing.

Remember, never accept one-sentence requirements; requirement information must never be only through verbal description! Otherwise, when the product manager denies it later, you'll have no way to prove it.

### 2. Don't Rush to Develop Before Upstream Is Confirmed

This point is similar to the previous one. For us programmers, there may be many upstreams from different positions and departments, like product managers who raise requirements, testers who verify functional points, developers who provide dependent interfaces, operations who provide resource permissions, etc.

If our requirement implementation must depend on some upstreams, personally I don't recommend directly starting development (but you can do design first). Because in work, there will always be various unexpected variables and risks.

For example, a while ago I needed to develop data table B based on data table A provided by another department. Initially they gave me data table A's structure, but it wasn't clear and they hadn't created the data table or written data. If I was new to work, I might have immediately written code based on this table structure. But later, their data table A's structure changed several times, and even changed table names several times! They apologized, but I just smiled: no problem, you guys change it, I haven't started yet. Wait until you deploy the table~

If this was before, I probably would have exploded mentally, haha.

So this point is quite useful and saved me quite a bit of time.

However, for urgent requirements, it's best to hold a meeting with all upstream colleagues to verify together, settle the solution first, then everyone divides the development work and aligns.



### 3. Learn to Reserve Buffer Space

As mentioned earlier, when I first joined the company, I was quite confident (thinking back now, a bit arrogant), always felt I could quickly complete requirements, and thought the faster I did requirements, the more I'd gain the boss's appreciation.

The result was scheduling requirements too tightly for myself - the previous requirement's bugs weren't fixed before the next requirement's deadline arrived. Not only did it exhaust me physically and mentally, but I also slapped my own face and let down others' expectations.

Plus, after being responsible for a project for a long time, I'd find that many times when doing new requirements, users would suddenly report a bug in a historical feature, and I'd have to immediately drop everything to fix it.

So later when doing requirements, I'd reserve more time for myself to prevent problems I didn't consider in advance from appearing. After all, everyone knows, sometimes debugging one bug can take a whole day...

![Reserve Time](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/1696339052824-38062959-00d7-4c9c-a00f-3583376a4737.png)

Even if I know clearly I can finish a requirement in 2 days, I might give myself more time. After all, if you can finish early, the other person will feel it exceeded expectations; if you finish on time, they'll feel it's normal; but if you don't finish on time due to some bugs, they'll feel "you're not very capable."

Is this also a kind of psychological game?



### 4. Learn to Manage Upward

In the workplace, many people clearly have strong technical abilities, but why don't they gain the boss's trust or get promoted for a long time?

A big reason is lack of **upward management** awareness.

Upward management refers to the ability to interact positively with superiors in daily work, proactively propose suggestions, solve problems, continuously provide feedback, and maintain relationships with superiors.

There are many ways to do good upward management, such as:

1) Proactively provide solutions: When you encounter problems or difficulties, don't just present the problem to your superior, but try to propose feasible solutions.

2) Continuous communication and feedback: It's recommended to regularly and honestly communicate with your superior within a reasonable range, including expressing your thoughts and plans, providing feedback on your work situation and results, and aligning with your superior on team goals.

Never say you did a lot of work you "thought was awesome," but your superior doesn't know about it, or it has no value to team and personal goals. That would be a pity.

3) Demonstrate self-leadership: You need not only work under leadership, but also make correct decisions when there's no clear leadership - what our company culture calls "ownership mindset."

4) Accept feedback: If your superior provides suggestions or criticism, don't view it as an attack, but as an opportunity to improve yourself. Actively respond to feedback, showing your willingness to learn and grow.



## II. Time Management Methods

1. Create Clear Task Lists

Organize your daily tasks by priority, check them off ✅ one by one to increase motivation.

2. Time Slicing

Segment your day's time, focusing on completing one small task per segment to reduce pressure from continuous high-intensity work.

3. Break Down Complex Tasks

Divide big tasks into small steps and tackle them gradually. Especially suitable for writing papers, doing big projects and plans. When you feel something is hard to do, you must do this.

4. Learn to Give Up at the Right Time

Decline some unimportant tasks. Don't let small things interfere with your rhythm.

5. Reduce Invalid Information

Limit time spent scrolling on your phone. Set to do-not-disturb when working. You're someone who will do great things, how can you be addicted to TikTok, Kuaishou, or Xiaohongshu?

6. Balance Work and Rest

Rest is very necessary. After working or studying for a while, go get a cup of water~

7. Use Fragmented Time

If you're really busy, use fragmented time like commutes to complete small tasks, like replying to messages, reading articles, memorizing words, etc.

8. Batch Process Tasks

Concentrate on handling similar tasks to save switching time. I also advise this to operations and sales colleagues in my team. If they check messages every minute, there's no continuous time for other work.

9. Countdown Method

Forcefully add a time limit to tasks, encouraging yourself to complete quickly. Students who've watched my tutorials should know, the classic "20 minutes" serves this purpose.



## III. Task Management


### 1. Don't Rely on Human Brain Memory

Never rely on "human brain" to remember things. Like when I walk out of my office, several colleagues might ask me to confirm various matters. Maybe by the time I go get a cup of water and come back, I'll have forgotten some. So you must have your own task recording tool.

What tools does everyone use to record work tasks?

I used to use TickTick, like an advanced memo, but later stopped using it because it required opening extra software and wasn't convenient enough.



### 2. Use WeChat for Recording

Now, the temporary recording tool I use most is exactly the software we use every day — WeChat.

In my work WeChat, File Transfer Assistant is always pinned. When I'm not in front of the computer, whenever I think of or receive some work matters, I send them to File Transfer Assistant and mark as unread. Every time I open WeChat afterward, there's a prominent red dot reminder.

![File Transfer Assistant](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20240804144855349.png)

If I receive work messages I can't handle immediately, after reading I also mark them as unread and pin the chat, reminding myself to handle them later. "Read but not replied" situations at work are actually quite normal. The other party might just be temporarily unable to reply, or hasn't figured out how to reply.



### 3. Use Work Record Sheet

Besides using WeChat to record temporary work messages, you definitely need a more systematic tool to record daily work tasks.

The tool I use is Tencent Docs' online Excel spreadsheet. On one hand, it opens directly in WeCom or browser; on the other hand, current online Excel spreadsheet functions are very flexible, making it convenient to record information according to your needs, group information, etc.

For example, I group by daily date, recording work tasks, notes, related documents, work progress, etc. If one day's work isn't finished, I just change the date to the next day; if worried I'll forget a task later, I just record it in the sheet in advance.

Going through the work record sheet every day makes it less likely to miss work, easier to arrange your time, and you can review your past by looking at records.

Here's an example of my work record sheet:

![Work Record Sheet](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20240804143618230.png)

After leading a team, I also have a habit: every weekend, I plan the next week's overall personal and team work in advance,便于提前做好准备、更好地把控进度, making work orderly.



### 4. Review Red Dots Before Sleep

Since I receive many work messages, it's impossible to reply to every message quickly. Otherwise, I can't calm down to do one thing well.

But every night before sleep, I go through the "red dots" in WeChat/WeCom to confirm no messages were missed. This is probably also a main reason my sleep time isn't fixed.

## IV. Daily Recording and Summary

Often friends complain to me: I've been in the company for a long time, but feel like I haven't grown much, and when reporting, don't know what to say.

If you also have this thought, most likely you don't have a daily summary habit.

A problem I had before: when taking notes watching online classes, sometimes I'd be lazy and think I'd watch a few more episodes and record together. The reality is often, as I watch more episodes, the unrecorded episodes pile up, I feel increasing pressure to record notes, and in the end just don't record.

Are there students like this too?

Work summary is the same. Everyone should immediately record it after completing each day's work, each requirement, each phased result. Develop a daily recording habit, and regularly organize, summarize, and review. Otherwise, you'll pile it up until too lazy to record, and when writing summaries, forget what you did this year.

I've maintained this habit for 3 years. Must say, it's helped me greatly. It also constantly makes me reflect on my work rhythm and state, motivating myself to try and break through.



## V. Efficiency Improvement Rules

1. Complete Confirmed Work First

When not sure what to do, first do clear tasks. Like when I write articles without inspiration, I won't force it, but do other things first, controlling overall work progress.

2. Done Is Better Than Perfect

Don't overly pursue perfection; completion is more important than perfection. Agile development and continuous iteration embody this principle. (Of course, if imperfect completion is meaningless to you, just follow your own pace.)

3. If There's Existing Code, Don't Write Your Own

Except when learning.

4. Before Doing Projects, Think Clearly How to Do Them

Do sufficient preliminary research and design. This not only facilitates future program expansion, but also avoids meaningless rework.

5. Break Down Large Goals

Make good plans, mark key nodes. Don't procrastinate because goals seem unreachable, and don't relax from blind optimism.

6. Develop Good Work/Rest Habits

Find your golden time for work. (Unfortunately, my golden time is in the early morning...)

7. If Bad Memory, Record More

Even if you really can't remember, you can use documents and bookmark software as your second brain.

8. Accumulate Your Own Tool Library

Coordinate with search software for instant access.

9. Communicate More with Team Members

You can also follow some UP owners to broaden knowledge channels and learn more tools and methods. Some things, as long as you've heard of them, can save hours of search time when needed.

10. Find Ways to Enter Flow State

Like putting on headphones, chewing gum, drinking coffee, deep breathing, etc.

11. Things Experienced Before, Usually Faster When Done Again

Therefore, do more projects and continuously accumulate experience. Practice makes perfect.



## In Conclusion

Maybe some friends will think: planning everything, trapping your life in Excel work sheets, so tiring!

I want to say: yes, it's really tiring. But after developing the habit of recording and planning, I'm no longer confused about what I do, but more goal-oriented, knowing what to do next, and not worried about delaying things. Plus, seeing my work record sheet filled with 100% progress gives me a huge sense of accomplishment!

That's all. Though relatively abstract, if you savor it carefully, I believe you'll feel suddenly enlightened and inspired.

In summary, hope these skills help everyone. Get promoted and get a raise soon~
