# Essential Software Tools for Programmers

> 3000+ programmer efficiency tool collection, click to use



Hello, I'm Fish Skin the programmer.

In the [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn) group, I often see students asking: what tools to use for drawing flowcharts and architecture diagrams? Just starting to learn programming, which code editor is recommended to download? Which AI tool is actually good to use?

Always getting stuck on the "finding tools" step in daily life is really exhausting.

So we launched [Programming Resource Tools Collection], a one-stop collection of various artifacts needed for the entire programmer workflow, search and use, greatly improving work efficiency!
