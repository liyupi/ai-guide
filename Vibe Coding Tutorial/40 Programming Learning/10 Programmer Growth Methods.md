# Six Methods for Rapid Programmer Growth

> How to grow quickly at work and break through career bottlenecks



Hello, I'm Fish Skin the programmer.

In the blink of an eye, another year has passed. Many students have just entered the workplace and inevitably feel anxious and confused about future growth.

Today I want to discuss a very realistic question with everyone: if you go to an outsourcing company, or your work itself doesn't bring you growth, how should you break through?

Run, run fast!

Just kidding. Since work can't bring you growth, then learn on your own. Just treat work purely as a transaction of money for labor.

This question is actually quite big. Considering everyone might not like listening to hollow theories, I'll directly share my own approach, as well as what I've observed some fast-growing experts do.

## I. Read a Few Articles Daily

Yes, just read 2 ~ 3 articles daily. No need for many, just enough to form a habit.

But you must read selectively, not everything.

What articles to read? First is **industry trend** articles, keeping you always following this industry, able to discuss new things with colleagues and interviewers. For example, AI became hot, first understand whether AI will affect you. If so, then learn AI-related tools.

Second is **technical articles**, but must be combined with your work-related direction. Suppose you read 2 ~ 3 articles daily, how many is that per year? Nearly 1000 articles! Convert that to tutorials, that could be dozens of tutorials. This is absolutely huge for your growth, and it's very relaxed work.

I also persist in doing this. Even though I run a company now, I read even more articles, because now I need to not only understand industry trends and technology, but also understand products, project management, even how to recruit.

Some students ask where to read articles? Most recommended is **big company technical blogs**. I follow a bunch of technical teams. Of course, the shared content might be quite hardcore. There's also tech news, experience sharing, programming trends, technical dry goods. My account basically shares everything.

Like this year we also built a completely free AI community where everyone can browse when free: https://ai.codefather.cn

## II. Continuously Learn New Technologies

If you can achieve the above point, congratulations, you can level up and increase daily study time, because some knowledge isn't recommended for fragmented learning.

You can try spending less than an hour daily, watching 2 ~ 3 tutorial episodes. Just persist for one month, and you can finish a course. If during your work, you can do this for 6 months in a year, then you won't be eliminated.

Here's an important point: **layoffs don't equal elimination**. You were laid off, not necessarily your problem, because the company might be poorly managed or not doing the right thing. This is the worst case. Don't let uncontrollable factors affect your confidence.



## III. Review and Summarize

This is something I've been doing all along, and this review and summary is quite simple:

Step 1: Daily record your completed work.

You fixed a bug today, record it, takes less than a minute; you finished a requirement, record it, attach a document, it's that simple. Like I used to record generally before leaving work daily.

Step 2: Monthly record what you focused on this month, as well as completed work, learning situation, etc.

When I first started interning, I recorded every day. I not only recorded work content, but also insights and gains. Like after communicating with my mentor, many ideas, I'd record them.

Step 3: Every half year, or after completing something major, do a review summary.

This review summary is relatively more complete, recording your experience, process, results of doing this thing, as well as what was good and bad. After you finish recording this point, when doing the next thing, you won't step in the same holes again. Plus many companies require semi-annual or annual performance reviews. If you already have recorded summaries before, writing this stuff is just copy-paste!



## IV. Organize Your Arsenal

What do you think is the biggest difference or extra thing between someone with 3 years of work and someone with 1 year?

It's experience!

You can't say someone with 3 years of work has the same accumulated content as someone with 1 year. Even if the remaining 2 years were all CRUD, you'd become a CRUD master.

So why do some people with 3 years of work seem the same as 1 year?

Because although he indeed worked 3 years, by the 3rd year, he forgot everything from the 1st year. The system design proposals he made, the technologies he touched, all forgotten.

Actually, forget 3 years, I don't even remember what code I wrote 1 month ago.

**Experience accumulation is an important factor determining how far and stably you can go in your future path.**

How to accumulate?



### 1. Organize Your Own Bug Library

That is, problems you've solved, very likely to become material for communicating with interviewers.



### 2. Organize Your Own Experience Library

That is, tips and holes you've stepped in at work, not limited to programming aspects, can also be workplace experience. Like what I realized myself:

- Don't give yourself entirely to the company
- Don't reveal all your cards
- Don't let your boss think this is all you have
- Can be friends with colleagues, but maintain boundaries

Although some experiences might not be correct, this is also what you've沉淀.



### 3. Organize Knowledge Points You've Learned

Record and organize all knowledge points you've learned in fragmented form.

What are fragments?

Take the project knowledge fragments I broke down for everyone in Programming Navigation as an example. So-called knowledge fragments are very small knowledge points that you can extract and apply to any project.

For example, how to use Ant Design Pro framework is a knowledge fragment; how to initialize a Java project is a very simple knowledge fragment.

Why do I suggest everyone organize fragments?

First, organizing fragments is simple. You just write clearly a very small knowledge point. Even if it only takes 5 minutes, write it out. This way you don't have that "I need to write a long treatise" burden, helping you form a habit.

Like Fish Skin has an interesting habit, I "口遁" (talk it out). Sometimes when I want to record, I just pull out my phone and babble randomly, using voice-to-text to quickly record. Truth be told, some articles are all 口遁 by me. Students who've watched my livestream should know, give me a topic, I can babble a bunch of random stuff.

Second, why break into fragments? Because each fragment is reusable. Later when you want to do your own project, just open the organized knowledge fragment list and look. For example, can this project add global permission management? Can it add caching? If you find you can add, just click into the specific knowledge fragment and see how I did it before.



### 4. Accumulate Your Own Tool Library

What do you use to take notes? What do you use to write documents? What to make mind maps?

These are all things you can organize.

For example, I often go online to learn things and inadvertently discover a new treasure tool. If I don't accumulate it, when I really need to use this tool, I might not think of it.

Ideally, when you switch computers, you can quickly complete installation of your commonly used tools on your new computer. This fulfills the purpose of a tool library.



## V. Share

This is really my real experience, you can all see it.

**Note: sharing doesn't equal doing self-media!** Self-media might be a later stage of sharing. When you have enough shared content, then doing self-media is natural, not forced.

How to do it?

Remember the several suggestions I mentioned earlier? Now do you already have a pile of your own dry goods? For example:

1. Share your review summaries and experiences
2. Share your arsenal
3. Share knowledge points you've learned
4. Help others answer questions

As long as you achieve these 4 points, and persist, even without specifically planning to do self-media, you will definitely gain some fans and definitely get some attention.

Remember when I first started doing self-media, I shared only interview questions. Why? Because during that time I was job hunting, and I was looking at this stuff every day, so I shared it by the way. That's all. No need to add extra burden for myself. I shared to help myself deepen impressions.

You'll find that the growth methods I mentioned earlier are all in sequence, very natural things that can be done at work and bring you growth. First learn technology, continuously accumulate, then review and summarize, during review and summary continuously organize, after organizing then share it out.



## VI. Learn to Break Down Goals

In the process of doing the above things, you need to continuously practice an operation, which is **breaking down goals**.

When you realize doing something very big is difficult, you need to learn to break down this goal. Break a big thing into more certain, simpler, even small things you can learn in fragmented time.

For example, you want to pass English CET-4, can break it down to memorizing 10 words daily, memorizing 50 words weekly and reviewing, memorizing 200 words monthly and reviewing.

Sometimes the reason everyone doesn't do things, is it because they feel too difficult? I'll worry I can't complete it, I'll feel I'm busy with work, maybe want to do today, tomorrow work gets busy and I put it aside. **Because of many uncertainties, we end up not being able to do anything.**

So everyone must learn to break down work, break down goals, break it into a route, a very clear document. Even if you leave it for 7 days in the middle, as long as you pick it up, you can continue step by step according to the document, then you can complete it.

If you feel something is very difficult, then start with simple things. If you feel a small plan is still difficult, break it down further. If you feel watching one class is difficult, break it down further, into watching 10 minutes daily, 4 days to finish a 40-minute class. Doing this at least guarantees you have some gains, not unable to start anything.

**The best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago. The second best time is now.**

It's never too late to start, because there are many students starting later than you. Just start persisting for 7 days from tomorrow, then try persisting for 21 days, you will definitely realize your progress.

The above is my sharing about how programmers improve themselves after work. Of course, I believe it's not limited to programmers; any work is applicable. Hope it helps everyone!
