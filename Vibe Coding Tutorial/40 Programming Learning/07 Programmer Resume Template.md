# Programmer Resume Template

> Create a professional resume in just 1 minute



Hello, I'm Fish Skin the programmer.

In 4 years of knowledge sharing, I've helped friends review over a thousand resumes. It's no exaggeration to say that the vast majority of students' resumes can only be described as "dreadful."

There are several most typical resume-writing problems, such as:

- Resume is too short, don't know what to write
- Resume layout is not neat enough, overly flashy
- Professional skills section is not professional enough
- Sentences in the resume are not smooth
- Resume content contains typos

Students who aren't job hunting yet, don't think resume writing has nothing to do with you. If you can become aware of these problems early and master resume writing methods, you won't embarrass yourself when job hunting time comes.

As a programmer, whenever I see these problems, I fall into contemplation: Is there a way to automatically help everyone discover resume problems? Help everyone write better resumes faster?

To solve these problems, after researching over a dozen resume writing platforms, I decided to lead our team in developing a brand new online resume creation website — **Old Fish Resume**!

## I. Quickly Generate Resumes

Old Fish's first major capability is rapid resume generation. In less than a minute, it can help you generate a basic resume.

We provide 3 ways to create resumes.


### 1. Resume Templates

An excellent resume is more about content; layout only needs to be simple and neat, no flashiness needed.

Old Fish provides multiple simple and professional resume templates. Click once to create a neat and beautiful resume, no more wasting time on layout!

![Resume Templates](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%E5%9C%881-20231122134518132.png)

Old Fish also provides resume templates for popular positions, with many ready-made resume content references, giving everyone ideas and inspiration for writing resumes.

For example, the frontend internship resume template, one-click to use:

### 2. AI Quick Resume Generation

Many students writing resumes for the first time may be completely unclear about how to write a resume, totally confused.

To address this, we developed the AI resume generation feature. Just fill in your target position and briefly describe your basic situation to quickly generate a job-seeking resume!

![AI Generate Resume](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20230927133412261-20231122134518373.png)

The generation effect is as follows, with school, professional skills, and work experience all filled in:

![Generation Effect](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20230927133641303.png)

However, note that AI-generated content is not fixed. The more detailed information you provide, the better the effect will be~


### 3. Multiple Format Resume Import

I believe many students' resumes might still be written in Word. But actually, I strongly don't recommend submitting Word format resumes, which may have layout issues and are not conducive to maintenance and updates.

Old Fish Resume supports quick import of resume files in multiple formats like Word, PDF, JPG, PNG, Markdown, Doc, Html, etc., easily helping you achieve "resume cloud migration." After that, delivering and sharing resumes will be much more convenient~

## II. Quickly Optimize Resumes

After creating a basic resume, the next step is to write and optimize the resume based on your actual situation.

Old Fish Resume provides various practical features to help everyone solve common resume writing problems:


### 1. Real-time Resume Editing and Preview

First is a simple and easy-to-use resume editor. Edit on the left, preview in real-time on the right. It also supports flexible style adjustment and one-click theme template switching. The resume writing experience is maximized~

![Resume Editor](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20230927135123890-20231122134518974.png)


### 2. Custom Resume Modules

Supports freely adding modules, rich text customizing content and format, etc., almost meeting all your resume modification needs!

### 3. Intelligent Error Correction

As mentioned at the beginning, many students' resumes have typos. Especially for technical positions, one typo can greatly affect the interviewer's impression of you and may cause your resume to be directly rejected!

To solve this problem, Old Fish Resume provides one-click `Intelligent Error Correction` functionality. It not only helps you quickly correct typos, but also optimizes professional terms, capitalization, incorrect punctuation, sentence coherence, etc.:

### 4. Intelligent Single Page

Although resume length isn't strictly required to be one page, it's generally recommended to keep it to one page, or ensure the first page of the resume contains the content that best reflects your personal ability and value.

But some students might have written exactly one page plus a tiny bit more. What to do?

Old Fish Resume provides `Intelligent Single Page` functionality, which can adjust resume layout with one click and automatically optimize to one page:

![Intelligent Single Page](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/cef2eaf8-39de-47bb-84a8-a69d8879a5a2-20231122134519390.png)


### 5. Resume Assistant

This is what we consider the most practical feature. Many students, due to lack of resume writing or practical experience, may have no idea how to write resume content.

To solve this problem, Old Fish Resume provides rich `Resume Example Sentences` and `Resume Suggestions` for various positions and modules, helping everyone quickly improve their resumes and learn resume writing experience and methods.

For example, quickly reference professional skill example sentences:

Learn how to write good professional skills and common problems:

![Resume Suggestions](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image%20(6)-20231122134519691.png)

Don't underestimate resume writing techniques. Sometimes, a detail can super-charge your resume!

For example, in Fish Skin's resume, he mentioned being responsible for the website construction studio during college and building multiple websites for the school. By including a real website link, he greatly increased the credibility of the experience. Similarly, everyone should ideally provide project or document addresses for projects they've worked on.

![Resume Example](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20230927141549926-20231122134519763.png)


### 6. AI Optimize Resume Content

Each module supports AI optimization functionality. With just one click, AI helps you quickly optimize resume content, making sentences smoother, content more coherent, and expression more professional!

### 2. Online Resume Link Sharing

You can generate a very simple and clean online resume page link for your written resume, making it easy to share with interviewers or HR.
