# Programming Knowledge Encyclopedia

Hello, I'm Fish Skin the programmer, former Tencent full-stack developer, [AI programming blogger](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453) with 2 million followers across the internet, and creator of 10+ self-developed products like [AI Navigation](https://ai.codefather.cn) and [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn).

When learning programming, you often encounter various concepts and technologies, like "What is RESTful API", "What is microservices", "What is Docker". Searching on search engines gives you a bunch of articles - some too simple, some too complex, and you're still confused after reading them.

To solve this problem, I created a **Programming Knowledge Encyclopedia** series on [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn) and [Bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453/lists/6264323), using anime-style explanations for programming knowledge, easy to understand, even zero foundation learners can understand.
