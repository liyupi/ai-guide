## What's in Fish Skin's AI Navigation?


There are more opportunities in the AI era than you can imagine. Many aspects of our team's daily work now have AI assistance, and in life we're increasingly getting used to asking AI for advice on everything. Especially in many unfamiliar areas with cognitive barriers, AI can help us quickly collect, filter, and analyze information. Many problems that used to take months just to find materials and read books can be sorted out by AI in minutes.

But faced with massive AI tools and resources, how do you find what really suits you?

[Fish Skin's AI Navigation Website](https://ai.codefather.cn/) can help you solve this problem.
