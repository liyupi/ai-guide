# Vibe Coding Experience & Techniques Overview

> Key skills to improve AI development efficiency and quality



Hello, I'm Programmer Fish Skin, former Tencent full-stack developer, [AI programming blogger](https://space.bilibili.com/12890453) with 2 million followers across the internet, and creator of 10+ self-developed products including [AI Navigation](https://ai.codefather.cn) and [Programming Navigation](https://www.codefather.cn).

If you've completed the [Essential Basics] learning and built your first project hands-on, then congratulations — you've stepped through the doors of Vibe Coding.

But you might find that although you can create things with AI, some aspects don't feel smooth enough. For example, AI sometimes "goes on strike," generated code quality varies, or projects become chaotic halfway through. These are all normal phenomena, because from "can do" to "do well," there's still an advanced path to walk.

This section is prepared to help you walk this path well. I'll share some practical experience and techniques to help you move faster and more steadily on your Vibe Coding journey.



## I. What is this section?

This section mainly covers how to improve your Vibe Coding level.

You might ask: I can already make things with AI, why learn these?

Actually, like traditional programming, Vibe Coding has beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. Beginner level can make things that work, but intermediate and advanced levels can make things that work **well**. This "work well" is reflected in:

- Higher development efficiency, won't get stuck on AI's small problems
- Better code quality, projects easier to maintain and extend
- Can handle more complex requirements, not just make simple demos
- Know how to avoid pitfalls, take fewer detours

This section is the bridge to help you move from beginner to intermediate/advanced.



## II. What's the use of learning this?

After completing the basics, many students encounter these confusions:

- I can make things, but it doesn't feel professional enough
- AI-generated code is sometimes messy, I don't know how to fix it
- Projects become chaotic halfway through, I don't know how to continue

If you also have these troubles, this section is prepared for you. After learning, you'll become a Vibe Coding hexagon warrior!

1. Efficiency improvement: You can complete projects faster and won't get stuck on small problems for too long.

2. Quality improvement: What you make is more stable and easier to maintain, no longer a "one-time toy."

3. Capability improvement: You can handle more complex requirements, advancing from making demos to making products.

4. Mindset improvement: You'll have more confidence and know how to solve problems when you encounter them.

These skills are not only applicable to Vibe Coding, but also very helpful for your understanding of the essence of software development.



## III. What does this section include?

This section covers all aspects of Vibe Coding from entry to mastery, with content divided into four categories by theme:
