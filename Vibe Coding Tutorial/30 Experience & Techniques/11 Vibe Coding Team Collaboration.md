# Vibe Coding Team Collaboration Techniques

> Using Vibe Coding to make projects with others



Hello, I'm Fish Skin.

In actual work, many projects are completed through team collaboration.

You might think: does AI development still need team collaboration? Can't everyone just use AI themselves?

Actually not. Many problems need to be solved in team collaboration, like inconsistent code generated by different people using AI (A uses React, B uses Vue), A changes code but B doesn't know, everyone modifying the same file causing conflicts, etc.

In Vibe Coding team collaboration, besides traditional team collaboration methods, you can also leverage the characteristics of AI development tools to improve efficiency. In this article, I'll share some best practices for teams using Vibe Coding.



## I. Code Standards and Style

The first step in team collaboration is unifying code standards.



### Why Need Unified Standards?

If everyone uses AI to generate code in different styles, the project will become very chaotic. For example, A uses React Class components, B uses function components; A uses CSS Modules, B uses Tailwind; A's variable names are camelCase, B's are snake_case...

Such code is hard to maintain and hard to collaborate on. So, teams need unified code standards.



### Establish Code Standards Document

You can create a `CODE_STYLE.md` document that clearly specifies the following content.

1) Tech stack standards:

- Frontend framework: React 19 + TypeScript
- State management: Zustand
- Styling solution: Tailwind CSS
- Routing solution: React Router v6

2) Code style standards:

- Components: functional components + Hooks
- Naming: components use PascalCase, functions use camelCase, constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- File organization: one component per file, filename matches component name
- Import order: React → third-party libraries → project internal modules

3) Comment standards:

- Complex logic must have comments
- Comments should explain "why" not just "what"
- Use JSDoc format to add documentation for functions

Recommend putting this document in the project root directory so everyone can see it.



### Use Linter and Formatter

Having just documentation isn't enough - many people have documents but just don't read them, you need tools to enforce them.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260105172241747.png)

ESLint is a code checking tool that can automatically discover problems and non-compliant areas in code.

Prettier is a code formatting tool that can automatically unify code format, like indentation, line breaks, quotes, etc.

Two swords combined, specifically for bad code!

If you don't understand these tools, no problem, you can directly have AI help you install and configure:

```markdown
Please help me configure ESLint and Prettier to ensure team code style is consistent.
```

AI will help you create the `.eslintrc.json` code checking configuration file in the project root:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "error",
    "no-console": "warn"
  }
}
```

Create the `.prettierrc` code formatting configuration file:

```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "printWidth": 100
}
```

And add scripts in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx",
    "lint:fix": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --fix",
    "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{ts,tsx}\""
  }
}
```

This way, everyone runs `npm run lint:fix && npm run format` before submitting code, and code will automatically conform to standards.



### Unify AI Configuration

If the team all uses Cursor, you can add a `.cursorrules` file to the project to unify AI behavior:

```
Project: [Project Name]

Tech Stack:
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand

Code Standards:
- Use functional components
- All components must have TypeScript type definitions
- Styles only use Tailwind CSS
- Don't use any type

Please all team members follow these standards.
```

This way, code generated by different people using AI will have more consistent style.

If the team uses Claude or other AI tools, you can also unify standards through similar methods. For example, at the start of each conversation, first have AI read the project's standards document, or add the team's code standards to the system prompt. The specific approach for different tools may vary, recommend checking the AI tool's official documentation.



## II. Team Collaboration Features of AI Programming Tools

Modern AI programming tools provide dedicated team collaboration features that can greatly improve team efficiency.



### Cursor Team Edition

Cursor provides a dedicated [team edition](https://cursor.com/cn/docs/account/teams) that includes these features:

1) Team management and permission control

You can create teams, invite members, set different roles and permissions. Administrators can control who can access which features, view the team's usage and billing.

2) Shared configuration files

Through shared rules files, the team can unify AI behavior standards. All members' AI will follow the same code standards, tech stack requirements, and output formats, ensuring generated code style is consistent.

3) Usage analysis and monitoring

Team administrators can view the team's AI usage, including which members use the most, which models were used, how much cost was incurred, etc. This can help optimize the team's AI usage strategy.

### Claude Sharing Capabilities

Claude provides [Projects functionality](https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects), particularly suitable for team collaboration:

1) Project-level knowledge base

You can create independent knowledge bases for each project, upload project-related documents, code, standards, etc. When team members use Claude in this project, AI will automatically reference this knowledge, keeping context consistent.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/claudeprojectknowledge.png)

2) Custom instructions

You can set custom instructions for each project, like "use formal tone", "answer from a data analyst's perspective", etc. When team members use it, AI will automatically follow these instructions.

3) Conversation sharing

Claude Team users can share excellent conversations to the team's activity feed. Other members can see how others use AI, learn different questioning techniques and solutions, improving the entire team's AI usage level.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/claudeshare.jpeg)

4) Team shared `CLAUDE.md` file

Even without using Projects functionality, you can use Git to manage the `CLAUDE.md` file, achieving team member sharing and maintenance.

Whenever you find Claude did something wrong, add it to `CLAUDE.md`, so Claude will know not to do that next time. This file will gradually accumulate the team's development experience and standards, becoming the team's shared knowledge base.



## III. Documentation-Driven Development

Good documentation is the foundation of team collaboration.



### Importance of Project Documentation

In teams, documentation is more important than in individual development. Because the code you write isn't just for yourself to see, but also for others to see. Good documentation lets team members quickly understand the project, reducing communication costs.

Essential documentation includes:

- README.md: Project overview and usage instructions
- CONTRIBUTING.md: How to participate in development
- CODE_STYLE.md: Code standards
- API.md: API interface documentation
- CHANGELOG.md: Version update records



### README.md Content

README.md is the project's face, like a book's cover and table of contents. It's the first file new members see when joining the project, and also the window for other developers to understand your project. A good README lets people quickly understand the project and quickly get started with development.

A good README.md should include:

- Project introduction: what this project does, what problems it solves
- Quick start: how to install dependencies, configure environment, run the project
- Tech stack: what technologies were used, why these technologies were chosen
- Directory structure: purpose of main folders
- Development standards: code style, submission standards, etc.
- Common problems: problems newbies easily encounter and solutions



### API Documentation

If the project has backend APIs, write clearly how each interface is used. You can use tools like Swagger, Postman, or AI to generate API documentation, or manually write Markdown documentation.

Each interface should explain:

- Request method and path
- Request parameters (type, whether required, description)
- Response format
- Error code description
- Usage examples



### Let AI Help You Write Documentation

Writing documentation is boring, but AI can help you.

If you use AI programming tools like Cursor, Claude Code, the tool will automatically read the project structure as context - you don't even need to paste code yourself, just say:

```markdown
Please generate API documentation for this project
```

AI can automatically generate it based on the code.

If using other AI tools, you can manually paste code:

```markdown
Please generate documentation for this API interface:
【paste your code】

Documentation should include: interface description, request parameters, response format, usage examples
```

AI will generate a basic document, which you then adjust according to the actual situation.



## IV. Git Collaboration Workflow

Git is a version control system and also the core tool for team collaboration. It's like taking photos and archiving code, you can return to any previous version at any time. It can record who changed what code when, and team members can simultaneously develop different features, then merge them together.

💡 If you want to systematically learn and master Git, you can read [Fish Skin's Git & GitHub Learning Roadmap](https://www.codefather.cn/course/1789189862986850306/section/1789190804671012866).



### Branch Management Strategy

Branches are like parallel worlds of code. You can freely modify code in your own branch without affecting others. After modifications are complete, merge into the main branch, like moving your work results into the official version.

Team development should make good use of branch functionality. Common branch strategies are:

- main branch: stable production code, only accepts tested code
- develop branch: development branch, daily development happens here
- feature branches: each new feature opens a branch, like `feature/user-login`, `feature/post-editor`
- bugfix branches: branches opened when fixing bugs, like `bugfix/login-error`

The workflow is:

1. Create feature branch from develop branch
2. Develop on feature branch, after development is complete submit Pull Request
3. After review, merge into develop
4. Regularly merge develop into main

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/gitcooperate%E5%A4%A7.jpeg)



### Commit Standards

Unified commit messages make it easier for teams to track changes. Recommend using [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/zh-hans/v1.0.0/), a standardized commit message format that makes the purpose of each commit clear at a glance.

For example:

```
feat: add user login feature
fix: fix navigation bar display issue on mobile
docs: update API documentation
style: format code
refactor: refactor user service
test: add tests for login feature
chore: update dependency packages
```

Type + colon + space + brief description, everyone knows at a glance what this commit did.

Now many AI programming tools support generating commit messages, making it easier to follow standards.

### Pull Request Process

Pull Request (abbreviated PR) is a code merge request. When you complete development on your own branch, don't directly merge into the main branch, but create a PR and let others review your code. Only after review passes can you merge. It's like submitting homework for a teacher to grade, only after grading passes is it considered complete.

The specific process is:

- Create PR: Create PR on GitHub, clearly write what this change does, why it was changed this way.
- Code review: At least one other member reviews the code, checking functionality, code quality, whether it conforms to standards.
- Discussion and modification: If there are problems, discuss in the PR, submitter modifies based on feedback.
- Merge code: After review passes, merge into target branch.

Although this process adds one step, it can greatly improve code quality.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260105173137083.png)



### Resolving Conflicts

When multiple people collaborate, code conflicts are a common problem. When two people modify the same part of the same file, Git will prompt a conflict.

The steps to resolve conflicts are: first pull the latest code `git pull origin develop`, Git will mark the conflicting areas. Then manually edit the file, decide which part of the code to keep. After resolving conflicts, test to ensure functionality works normally, finally submit the resolved code.

To reduce conflicts, recommend:

1. Frequently pull the latest code, don't go too long without syncing
2. Merge promptly after feature development is complete, don't drag on too long
3. If modifying public files, communicate with the team in advance



## V. Code Review Process

Code review is the key to ensuring team code quality.



### Why Do Code Review?

Code review has many benefits.

First, it can discover potential bugs before code goes live, avoiding problems flowing into production. Second, it can unify code style, keeping project code consistent, avoiding situations where everyone's code style is different.

More importantly, code review is a great learning opportunity. Reviewers can see others' code ideas, reviewees can get improvement suggestions, both sides can learn. Also, knowing code will be reviewed, people naturally write more carefully, which can improve code quality from the source.



### Review Focus Points

When reviewing code, focus on these aspects:

1. Functional correctness: Does the code correctly implement requirements? Are there missing edge cases?
2. Code quality: Is the code clear and understandable? Is there duplicate code? Is naming standardized?
3. Performance issues: Are there obvious performance problems? Is the data structure choice reasonable?
4. Security issues: Are there security vulnerabilities? Is user input validated?
5. Test coverage: Are there sufficient tests? Do tests cover main scenarios?



### Review Techniques

Pay attention to method when reviewing. Don't just say "this is wrong", clearly explain why it's wrong and how to fix it. Use suggestive tone, not commanding tone. For example "I suggest using useMemo here to optimize performance" rather than "must use useMemo here". Of course, unless the team has hard requirements.

If there are multiple problems, prioritize. First point out important problems (like bugs, security vulnerabilities), then raise improvement suggestions (like naming, comments).

Review isn't one-time, can have multiple rounds of discussion. First round points out main problems, after modification review again, confirm no problems before merging.



### Let AI Assist Review

You can have AI help you do preliminary review:

```markdown
Please review this code, analyze from perspectives of functionality, performance, security, code quality:
【paste code】
```

AI will give you a detailed review report. But note, AI's review cannot completely replace human review, ultimately people still need to make the final decision.



#### Use Cursor's BugBot

Cursor provides a dedicated code review tool called [BugBot](https://cursor.com/cn/bugbot), which can automatically scan your code, find potential bugs, performance problems, and security vulnerabilities, and quickly fix them.

You can directly use this feature in Cursor, letting AI help you do preliminary code review.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/image-20260105173323498.png)



#### Claude Code Automated Code Review

If using Claude Code, you can mark `@.claude` in the Pull Request for code review, so Claude will automatically add review suggestions to the `CLAUDE.md` file. Then leverage GitHub Action to achieve automated updates, so the documentation will gradually accumulate the team's code quality standards and common problems.

This is also the approach recommended by Claude Code's founder, letting code review experience automatically accumulate.



#### Multiple AI Cross-Validation

To be more safe, you can have multiple different AIs review the same code. For example, first let Claude review once, then let GPT review once, compare their suggestions.

Different AIs might discover different problems, cross-validation can improve review comprehensiveness.



## VI. Team Collaboration Best Practices

Based on my experience, here I'll summarize some best practices for team collaboration.

💡 This part is mainly for team leaders or managers. If you're not a team manager, just a team member, you can skip this part, or just understand it.



### Regular Sync

Teams should regularly meet to sync progress, like daily standups (5 ~ 10 minutes), weekly meetings (30 ~ 60 minutes).

Standups mainly cover three things: what was done yesterday, what's planned for today, what problems were encountered.

Weekly meetings can deeply discuss technical solutions, share experiences, plan next week's work.

Besides meetings, you can also use tools to sync. For example, use tools like Jira to manage tasks, use enterprise WeChat, Feishu, Slack, etc. for daily communication, use Notion, Yuque, etc. to share documents.



### Pair Programming

For complex features, you can try pair programming. Two people develop together, one writes code (Driver), one reviews and suggests (Navigator), this not only improves code quality, but also promotes knowledge sharing.

Honestly, I rarely see companies actually do this, because the cost is too high.

But think about it carefully, in Vibe Coding, developing with AI, isn't that a form of pair programming?

AI is your programming partner, you raise requirements, it writes code; you review, it improves. This "human-AI pairing" might be more efficient than "human-human pairing".



### Knowledge Sharing

Teams should establish knowledge sharing mechanisms. Can arrange for one person to share each week about recently learned technologies, encountered problems, summarized experiences; or share how to use AI to solve a difficult problem, how to optimize a feature's performance, how to avoid a common pitfall; or沉淀 various technical and business knowledge into documents. This can improve the entire team's level, and also avoid repeating mistakes.

Our team uses Yuque knowledge base to share documents. Every problem encountered, experience summarized, techniques learned are recorded there. When new people join, they can directly look at the knowledge base to quickly get started.

![](https://pic.yupi.icu/1/%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E5%BA%93%E6%95%B0%E9%87%8F.png)



### Establish Shared Resources

Teams can establish some shared resources, like:

- Prompt template library: commonly used prompt templates
- Code snippet library: commonly used components and functions
- Problem solution library: encountered problems and solutions
- Best practice documentation: summarized experience and techniques

These resources let new people quickly get started, and also improve the entire team's efficiency.

You can use Git + GitHub to manage and share code files, or use various cloud storage software to store multimedia, just choose the tool the team is used to.



### Clear Division of Labor

Although everyone uses AI, still need clear division of labor. Who is responsible for frontend, who for backend, who for testing, who for deployment. Everyone has their own responsibilities, avoiding duplicate work or omissions.

At the same time, avoid AI dependency. Don't have everyone depend on AI, have someone who can step up when AI has problems. Maintain the team's technical ability, don't completely depend on tools.

This is also why programmers are still key today - AI is just a tool, truly understanding the business, controlling quality, making decisions is still people. **So don't worry AI will eliminate programmers, programmers who can use AI will only become stronger.**

💡 Although in enterprises everyone will collaborate in division of labor, I suggest everyone strive to broaden their ability boundaries. Frontend knows a bit of backend, backend knows a bit of frontend, testing knows a bit of development, this not only better understands the entire system, but can also step up in critical moments. In the AI era, strive to become a **super individual** who can independently complete full-stack projects, you'll be more competitive.



## In Conclusion

Team collaborative development is much more complex than individual development, but also more valuable. A well-coordinated team + AI can create projects far beyond individual + AI.

Finally, let me summarize this article's key points. Team collaborative development needs:

1. Unified code standards: Use documentation and tools to ensure code style consistency.
2. Leverage AI tool team features: Like Cursor team edition, Claude Projects, etc., achieve configuration sharing, knowledge sharing, conversation sharing, making AI the team's shared brain
3. Documentation-driven development: Write good documentation, let team members quickly understand the project
4. Standardize Git workflow: Use branch management, commit standards, PR process to ensure code quality
5. Seriously do code review: Review isn't a formality, but the key to improving quality.
6. Establish collaboration mechanisms: Regular sync, pair programming, knowledge sharing, shared resources
7. Clear division of labor: Everyone has their own responsibilities, while maintaining technical ability.

Vibe Coding won't change the essence of team collaboration, it's just a tool. Good team collaboration needs clear standards, good communication, and mutual trust.
